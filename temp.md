# Customized Content

Yes, your understanding is correct regarding the behavior of `tf.keras.layers.Dense` for inputs with a rank greater than 2. The `Dense` layer indeed uses a single kernel to operate across the last axis of the input tensor, applying the same kernel to each slice along the second-to-last dimension. This means that the outputs for different indices of the second dimension are not independent of each other, as they all share the same kernel during the operation.

To use a stack of kernels instead, thereby allowing for independent operations across the second dimension of the input tensor, you would indeed need to implement a custom layer. This custom layer would involve creating a kernel with a shape that accommodates the additional dimension(s) and performing the tensor multiplication accordingly.

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement such a custom layer in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomDenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDenseLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[1], input_shape[2], self.units),
            initializer='glorot_uniform',
            name='kernel')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[1], self.units),
            initializer='zeros',
            name='bias')

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Perform tensor multiplication using tf.einsum
        # This allows for different operations across the second dimension
        outputs = tf.einsum('bij,jik->bik', inputs, self.kernel)
        outputs += self.bias
        return self.activation(outputs)

# Example usage
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomDenseLayer(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 20)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
print(model.summary())
```

This custom layer (`CustomDenseLayer`) takes inputs of shape `(batch_size, d0, d1)` and applies a unique operation across the `d0` dimension using a stack of kernels, one for each slice along `d0`. The output shape from this layer will be `(batch_size, d0, units)`, where each slice along `d0` has been independently processed.

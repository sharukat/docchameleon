### Understanding the Documentation

The TensorFlow documentation for `tf.random.set_seed` explains how the global and operation-level seeds interact to determine the random sequence in TensorFlow operations. Here is a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Global Seed and Operation Seed Interaction**:
- If neither the global seed nor the operation seed is set, a randomly picked seed is used for the operation.
- If the global seed is set but the operation seed is not, a unique random sequence is determined in conjunction with the global seed. This sequence is deterministic within the same version of TensorFlow and user code.
- If the operation seed is set but the global seed is not set, a default global seed and the specified operation seed are used to determine the random sequence.
- If both the global and operation seed are set, both seeds are used together to determine the random sequence.

2. **Effects of Seed Settings**:
- Setting only the global seed without an operation seed will result in the same random sequence for every re-run of the program but different results for each call to the random operation.
- The reason for different results in consecutive calls to the same operation is due to the use of a different operation seed each time.

3. **Illustrative Examples**:
- The documentation provides examples to demonstrate the effects of setting the global seed and operation seed in different scenarios.
- It shows how setting both seeds can ensure consistent random sequences across iterations or re-runs of the program.

### Response to User's Question

The user's question revolves around the discrepancy between the expected behavior based on the documentation and the actual output observed in their code. They tested setting only the global seed and found that the output sequences in consecutive iterations of a loop were not as expected.

### Explanation and Solution

The user's code snippet sets only the global seed and then shuffles a constant tensor in a loop. The output sequences in consecutive iterations of the loop did not match the expected behavior based on the documentation.

The reason for this discrepancy is that setting only the global seed does not guarantee the same output in consecutive iterations of a loop. To ensure consistent output across iterations, both the global level seed and the operation level seed should be set.

In the provided code snippet, the operation seed is not explicitly set, leading to different operation seeds being picked for each call to `tf.random.shuffle`. This results in different output sequences in consecutive iterations of the loop.

To address this issue, the user should set both the global seed and the operation seed before running the loop. This will ensure that the random number generation is consistent across iterations, as demonstrated in the corrected code snippet below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(1234)

constant_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

# Set the operation level seed
tf.random.set_seed(5678)

for i in range(1, 15):
shuffled_tensor = tf.random.shuffle(constant_tensor)
print(shuffled_tensor)
```

By setting both the global and operation level seeds, the user can achieve the expected behavior of consistent output sequences in consecutive iterations of the loop.

### Alternative Resources

To avoid confusion and ensure clarity on setting seeds in TensorFlow operations, the documentation can be updated with a new section that provides step-by-step explanations and examples similar to the above response. This will help users understand how to correctly set seeds for consistent random number generation in TensorFlow operations.

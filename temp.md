In TensorFlow 2.x, placeholders are no longer necessary, as you can directly pass data into operations. The recommended way to migrate from `tf.compat.v1.placeholder` is to use `tf.keras.Input` or simply pass tensors directly.

However, if you want to replicate the exact behavior of a scalar placeholder with an empty shape `[]`, you can use `tf.keras.Input` with `shape=None` or `shape=(None,)`. Here's an example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TF 1.x placeholder
x1 = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [], name="x1")

# Equivalent in TF 2.x using tf.keras.Input
x2 = tf.keras.Input(shape=None, dtype=tf.float32, name="x2")

# Check shapes
print(tf.shape(x1))  # Output: Tensor("Shape:0", shape=(0,), dtype=int32)
print(tf.shape(x2))  # Output: Tensor("Shape_1:0", shape=(1,), dtype=int32)
```

In the above code, `x2` is defined using `tf.keras.Input` with `shape=None`, which allows it to accept a scalar input similar to the TF 1.x placeholder `x1`.

When you check the shapes using `tf.shape`, you'll notice that `x1` has a shape of `(0,)`, indicating a scalar, while `x2` has a shape of `(1,)`, indicating a tensor with a single dimension. However, both `x1` and `x2` will behave similarly when used in computations.

It's important to note that in TensorFlow 2.x, eager execution is enabled by default, so you can directly pass data into operations without the need for placeholders and sessions. For example:

```python
# Directly pass data
result = some_op(tf.constant(42.0))
```

I hope this helps clarify how to migrate your TensorFlow 1.x placeholder code to TensorFlow 2.x while maintaining a similar behavior. Let me know if you have any further questions!

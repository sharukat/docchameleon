You either need to load the images from the server the applet is been loaded from (using getDocument/CodeBase or a relative URL), or based on your example, as embedded an resource, for example

tileset_terrain = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(""/res/tileset_terrain.png""));
This assumes that the image is included within the Jar file under the /res directory.

If the image resides on the server from which the applet is been load, you could also use

try {
    URL url = new URL(getCodeBase(), ""res/tileset_terrain.png"");
    img = ImageIO.read(url);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

Whenever a new JVM is started the bootstrap classloader is responsible to load key Java classes (from java.lang package) and other runtime classes to the memory first. The bootstrap classloader is a parent of all other classloaders. Consequently, it is the only one without a parent.

Next comes the extension classloader. It has the bootstrap classloader as parent and is responsible for loading classes from all .jar files kept in the java.ext.dirs path–these are available regardless of the JVM’s classpath.

The third and most important classloader from a developer’s perspective is the system classpath classloader, which is an immediate child of the extension classloader. It loads classes from directories and jar files specified by the CLASSPATH environment variable, java.class.path system property or -classpath command line option.

Classloader hierarchy

ClassLoader Namespace

In Java a class is uniquely identified using ClassLoader + Class as the same class may be loaded by two different class loaders.

Class A loaded by ClassLoader A != Class A loaded by ClassLoader B
How is it helpful?

It is helpful for defining different protection and access policies for different classloaders. Take an example of applet which is loaded using a different classloader, you would not want a third party application all access to your resources. So for security its important to maintain different namespaces.",

swing,JPanel,how to set JFrame background transparent but JPanel or JLabel Background opaque?,"<p>If you are using JPanels  then are probably working with Swing.

<p>the keys will be enums and you can insert in any order you want but when you iterate it will iterate in the enum order (the natural order).

io,Serializable,Java Serializable Object to Byte Array,"<p>To add to the other answers  by implementating <code>java.io.Serializable</code>  you get  automatic  serialization capability for objects of your class.
The Java runtime will use reflection to figure out how to marshal and unmarshal your objects.</p>
<p>In earlier version of Java  reflection was very slow  and so serializaing large object graphs (e.g. in client-server RMI applications) was a bit of a performance problem.
<p>In recent versions of Java (1.3 onwards  certainly) the performance of reflection is vastly better than it used to be  and so this is much less of a problem.
<p>Also  the built-in Java serialization mechanism isn t the only one  you can get third-party replacements  such as JBoss Serialization  which is considerably quicker  and is a drop-in replacement for the default.</p>
<p>Serialization provides default functionality to store and later recreate the object.
In default serialization the object is constructed entirely from its stored bits  with no constructor calls.</p> <pre><code>  ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(       new FileOutputStream(&quot;/Users/Desktop/files/temp.txt&quot;));   oos.writeObject(linkedListHead); //writing head of linked list   oos.close(); </code></pre> <p>
But if you want restricted serialization or don t want some portion of your object to be serialized then use Externalizable.
The Externalizable interface extends the Serializable interface and adds two methods  writeExternal() and readExternal().
While working with Externalizable we should remember that the default constructer should be public else the code will throw exception.
Here if you comment the default constructer then the code will throw below exception:</p> <pre><code> java.io.InvalidClassException: javaserialization.
We can observe that as password is sensitive information  so i am not serializing it in writeExternal(ObjectOutput oo) method and not setting the value of same in readExternal(ObjectInput oi).

A Java object is only serializable.
Most of the java class are serializable</em>.</p>
<p>Object Serialization produces a stream with information about the Java classes for the objects which are being saved.
For serializable objects  sufficient information is kept to restore those objects even if a different (but compatible) version of the implementation of the class is present.
The Serializable interface is defined to identify classes which implement the serializable protocol:</p>
The serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to identify the semantics of being serializable.
For serializing/deserializing a class  either we can use default writeObject and readObject methods (or) we can overriding writeObject and readObject methods from a class.</li>
The values of the non-transient and non-static fields of the class get serialized.</li> </ul>
<p>For Externalizable objects  only the identity of the class of the object is saved by the container; the class must save and restore the contents.
The Externalizable interface has two methods  an externalizable object must implement a writeExternal and readExternal methods to save/restore the state of an object.</li> <li>
Programmer has to take care of which objects to be serialized.
As a programmer take care of Serialization So  here transient keyword will not restrict any object in Serialization process.</li> <li>
When an Externalizable object is reconstructed  an instance is created using the public no-arg constructor  then the readExternal method called.
<p>Default serialization is somewhat verbose  and assumes the widest possible usage scenario of the serialized object  and accordingly the default format (Serializable) annotates the resultant stream with information about the class of the serialized object.</p>
<p>Externalization give the producer of the object stream complete control over the precise class meta-data (if any) beyond the minimal required identification of the class (e.g. its name).
This is clearly desirable in certain situations  such as closed environments  where producer of the object stream and its consumer (which reifies the object from the stream) are matched  and additional metadata about the class serves no purpose and degrades performance.</p>
<p>Additionally (as Uri point out) externalization also provides for complete control over the encoding of the data in the stream corresponding to Java types.
For (a contrived) example  you may wish to record boolean true as  Y  and false as  N .
<p>The Externalizable interface was not actually provided to optimize the serialization process performance!
but to provide means of implementing your own custom processing and offer complete control over the format and contents of the stream for an object and its super types!</p>
<p>When considering options for improving performance  don t forget custom serialization.
You can let Java do what it does well  or at least good enough  <em>for free</em>  and provide custom support for what it does badly.
<p>There are so many difference exist between Serializable and Externalizable but when we compare difference between custom Serializable(overrided writeObject() &amp; readObject()) and Externalizable  then we find that custom implementation is tightly bind with ObjectOutputStream class where as in Externalizable case   we ourself provide an implementation of ObjectOutput which may be ObjectOutputStream class or it could be some other like org.apache.mina.filter.codec.serialization.ObjectSerializationOutputStream</p>
We can comment below two method and use default serialization process as well              Sequence of class attributes in read and write methods MUST BE same.
We can define custom validation or business rules inside read/write methods.
please check in/out object case of Externalizable.
Where as Outstream/Instream are tightly bind to classes.
We can extends ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream but it will a bit difficult to use.</p>
<code>Externalizable</code> contains 2 methods  <code>readExternal</code> and <code>writeExternal</code>.
allows the implementer to decide how an object is serialized  where as <code>Serializable</code>
<p>For long-term persistence  the class must be able to decode this form  which restricts the changes you can make to class design.
<p>Serialization can also lead to security problems.
By being able to serialize any object it has a reference to  a class can access data it would not normally be able to (by parsing the resultant byte data).</p>
<p>There are other issues  such as the serialized form of inner classes not being well defined.</p>
Net people got it wrong this time around  would have been better to make everything serializable by default and only need to mark those classes that can t be safely serialized instead.</p>
<p>For example in Smalltalk (a language created in 70s) every object is serializable by default.
I have no idea why this is not the case in Java  considering the fact that the vast majority of objects are safe to serialize and just a few of them aren t.
<p>Marking an object as serializable (with an interface) doesn t magically make that object serializable  <strong>it was serializable all along</strong>  it s just that now you expressed something that the system could have found on his own  so I see no real good reason for serialization being the way it is now.</p>
<p>Not everything is genuinely serializable.
You could serialize the data/state of your socket object  but the essence of an active connection would be lost.</p>
<p>The main role of Serializable in Java is to actually make  by default  all other objects nonserializable.
Serialization is a very dangerous mechanism  especially in its default implementation.
Hence  like friendship in C++  it is off by default  even if it costs a little to make things serializable.</p>
<p>Serialization adds constraints and potential problems since structure compatibility is not insured.
So the effort you d spend making the class serializble properly dwarves the cost of adding the interface.
<p>For some classes  especially those that represent something more physical like a File  a Socket  a Thread  or a DB connection  it makes absolutely no sense to serialize instances.
For many others  Serialization may be problematic because it destroys uniqueness constraints  or simply forces you to deal with instances of different versions of a class  which you may not want to.</p>
<p>Arguably  it might have been better to make everything Serializable by default and make classes non-serializable through a keyword or marker interface - but then  those who should use that option probably would not think about it.
<p>Apparently everything was serializable in some preliminary designs  but because of security and correctness concerns the final design ended up as we all know.</p>
<p>Having to state explicitely that instances of a certain class are Serializable the language forces you to think about if you you should allow that.
For simple value objects serialization is trivial  but in more complex cases you need to really think things through.</p>
<p>By just relying on the standard serialization support of the JVM you expose yourself to all kinds of nasty versioning issues.</p>
<p>Uniqueness  references to  real  resources  timers and lots of other types of artifacts are NOT candidates for serialization.</p>
Other languages happily try serializing everything that doesn t jump on a tree after you ve counted to 10.
An Object should default to be serializable.
<p>So  what you basically need to do is read all the properties of your 3rd-party class yourself.","If the object array contains Serializable objects then you can use java.io.ObjectOutputStream

<p>Then just add those numbers to the integer representation of the character <code>`</code>
<p>When <code>java.util.Random</code> is instantiated with a specific seed parameter (in this case <code>-229985452</code> or <code>-147909649</code>)  it follows the random number generation algorithm <em>beginning</em>
<p>Everyone here did a great job of explaining how the code works and showing how you can construct your own examples  but here s an information theoretical answer showing why we can reasonably expect a solution to exist that the brute force search will eventually find.</p> <p>
To allow generating words of different lengths  we further add a terminator symbol <code>‚ä•</code> to yield an extended alphabet <code>Œ£  := Œ£ ‚à™ {‚ä•}</code>.</p> <p>Let <code>Œ±</code> be a symbol and X a uniformly distributed random variable over <code>Œ£ </code>.
Since the Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized with a 32-bit seed  we can expect most words of length up to</p> <blockquote> <p>Œª = floor[32/log‚ÇÇ(27)] - 1 = 5</p> </blockquote> <p>to be generated by at least one seed.
Even if we were to search for a 6-character word  we would still be successful about 41.06% of the time.
<p>Most random number generators are  in fact   pseudo random. 
<p>LCGs are quite predictable given a fixed seed.
Basically  use a seed that gives you your first letter  then write an app that continues to generate the next int (char) until you hit the next letter in your target string and write down how many times you had to invoke the LCG.
<p>As multi-threading is very easy with Java  here is a variant that searches for a seed using all cores available: <a href= http://ideone.com/ROhmTA  rel= noreferrer >http://ideone.com/ROhmTA</a></p>
<p>To get different sequences  it s necessary initialize the sequence in some position  called  seed .</p>
<p>The randomSting get the random number in the i position (seed = -229985452) of the  random  sequence.
<p>The principal is the Random Class constructed with the same seed will generate the same pattern of numbers every time.</p>","Use Integer.parseInt (see javadoc), that converts your String to int using base two:

I suppose you are not using some ORM framework like Hibernate.

In this case, map the resultset data in the DAO or build an object mapper yourself, which maps the ResultSet to a some Data Transfer Object. Then pass this object to the createExcel() method.

Something like this:

ResultSet rs = myDao.getResult();
List<ExcelDto> excelDtos = new ArrayList<>();
ExcelDto excelDto;
while (rs.next()) {      
    excelDto = new ExcelDto();    
    dto.setXCol(rs.getString(""XColumn""))
    excelDtos.add(dto);  
}
excelCreator.createExcel(excelDtos);

steps in the worst case (start of list)</sup></p> <p><code>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</code> allows for constant-time insertions or removals <em>using iterators</em>  but only sequential access of elements.
In other words  you can walk the list forwards or backwards  but finding a position in the list takes time proportional to the size of the list.
Javadoc says <em>&quot;operations that index into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end  whichever is closer&quot;</em>  so those methods are <em>O(n)</em>
(<em>n/4</em> steps) on average  though <em>O(1)</em> for <code>index = 0</code>.</p> <p><code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code>  on the other hand  allow fast random read access  so you can grab any element in constant time.
But adding or removing from anywhere but the end requires shifting all the latter elements over  either to make an opening or fill the gap.
Iterating over either kind of List is practically equally cheap.
In an array list  the remainder of the array needs to be <em>moved</em> (i.e. copied).
the desired position can be computed mathematically and accessed in <em>O(1)</em>.</p> <p>
Another benefit of using a <code>LinkedList</code> arises when you add or remove from the head of the list  since those operations are <em>O(1)</em>  while they are <em>O(n)</em> for <code>ArrayList</code>.
LinkedList</code> for adding and removing from the head  but it is not a <code>List</code>.</p> <p>
Also  if you have large lists  keep in mind that memory usage is also different.
Each element of a <code>LinkedList</code> has more overhead since pointers to the next and previous elements are also stored.
The default initial capacity of an <code>ArrayList</code> is pretty small (10 from Java 1.4 - 1.8).
But since the underlying implementation is an array  the array must be resized if you add a lot of elements.
To avoid the high cost of resizing when you know you re going to add a lot of elements  construct the <code>ArrayList</code>
If the data structures perspective is used to understand the two structures  a LinkedList is basically a sequential data structure which contains a head Node.
The Node is a wrapper for two components : a value of type T [accepted through generics] and another reference to the Node linked to it.
Addition of elements takes linear time in LinkedList as stated above.</p> <p>An ArrayList is a growable array.
Under the hood  when an element is added  and the ArrayList is already full to capacity  it creates another array with a size which is greater than previous size.
The elements are then copied from previous array to new one and the elements that are to be added are also placed at the specified indices.</p>
<p>Thus far  nobody seems to have addressed the memory footprint of each of these lists besides the general consensus that a <code>LinkedList</code> is  lots more  than an <code>ArrayList</code>
In practice  the capacity of the backing array in an <code>ArrayList</code> is generally larger than its current element count.</p>
As CompressedOops is default now from mid JDK6 and up  the values below for 64-bit machines will basically match their 32-bit counterparts  unless of course you specifically turn it off.</p>
<p>The result clearly shows that <code>LinkedList</code> is a whole lot more than <code>ArrayList</code>  especially with a very high element count.
Note the reason for the mods is because all objects in java will take up a multiple of 8 bytes space regardless of whether it is all used or not.</p>
Any indexed operation requires a traversal  i.e. has O(n) performance.
This is not obvious in the source code  leading to algorithms O(n) slower than if <code>ArrayList</code> was used.</li> <li>
<p>ArrayLists are good for write-once-read-many or appenders  but bad at add/remove from the front or middle.</p>
As someone who has been doing operational performance engineering on very large scale SOA web services for about a decade  I would prefer the behavior of LinkedList over ArrayList.
While the steady-state throughput of LinkedList is worse and therefore might lead to buying more hardware -- the behavior of ArrayList under pressure could lead to apps in a cluster expanding their arrays in near synchronicity and for large array sizes could lead to lack of responsiveness in the app and an outage  while under pressure  which is catastrophic behavior.</p>
<p>Similarly  you can get better throughput in an app from the default throughput tenured garbage collector  but once you get java apps with 10GB heaps you can wind up locking up the app for 25 seconds during a Full GCs which causes timeouts and failures in SOA apps and blows your SLAs if it occurs too often.

ArrayList is only a better choice for performance if all you mean by performance is throughput and you can ignore latency.

The only situations where a LinkedList might make sense would be something highly contrived where you had thousands of Lists any one of which might grow to be GB-sized  but where no good guess could be made at allocation-time of the List and setting them all to GB-sized would blow up the heap.
And if you found some problem like that  then it really does call for reengineering whatever your solution is (and I don t like to lightly suggest reengineering old code because I myself maintain piles and piles of old code  but that d be a very good case of where the original design has simply run out of runway and does need to be chucked).

Also  if you have large lists  keep in mind that memory usage is also different.
Each element of a <code>LinkedList</code> has more overhead since pointers to the next and previous elements are also stored.
The default initial capacity of an <code>ArrayList</code> is pretty small (10 from Java 1.4 - 1.8).
But since the underlying implementation is an array  the array must be resized if you add a lot of elements.

If the data structures perspective is used to understand the two structures  a LinkedList is basically a sequential data structure which contains a head Node.
The Node is a wrapper for two components : a value of type T [accepted through generics] and another reference to the Node linked to it.
Addition of elements takes linear time in LinkedList as stated above.</p> <p>An ArrayList is a growable array.
Under the hood  when an element is added  and the ArrayList is already full to capacity  it creates another array with a size which is greater than previous size.

<p>Thus far  nobody seems to have addressed the memory footprint of each of these lists besides the general consensus that a <code>LinkedList</code> is  lots more  than an <code>ArrayList</code>

As someone who has been doing operational performance engineering on very large scale SOA web services for about a decade  I would prefer the behavior of LinkedList over ArrayList.
While the steady-state throughput of LinkedList is worse and therefore might lead to buying more hardware -- the behavior of ArrayList under pressure could lead to apps in a cluster expanding their arrays in near synchronicity and for large array sizes could lead to lack of responsiveness in the app and an outage  while under pressure  which is catastrophic behavior.</p>

import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlJavaTypeAdapter;

@XmlRootElement
public class Root {

    private Map<String, String> mapProperty;

    public Root() {

The implementation of the XmlAdapter is as follows:

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;

import javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;

import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.w3c.dom.Element;
import org.w3c.dom.Node;

public class MapAdapter extends XmlAdapter<AdaptedMap, Map<String, String>> {

    @Override
    public AdaptedMap marshal(Map<String, String> map) throws Exception {
        DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
        DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
        Document document = db.newDocument();
        Element rootElement = document.createElement(""map"");
        document.appendChild(rootElement);

        for(Entry<String,String> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            Element mapElement = document.createElement(entry.getKey());
            mapElement.setTextContent(entry.getValue());
            rootElement.appendChild(mapElement);
        }

        AdaptedMap adaptedMap = new AdaptedMap();
        adaptedMap.setValue(document);
        return adaptedMap;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, String> unmarshal(AdaptedMap adaptedMap) throws Exception {
        Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
        Element rootElement = (Element) adaptedMap.getValue();
        NodeList childNodes = rootElement.getChildNodes();
        for(int x=0,size=childNodes.getLength(); x<size; x++) {
            Node childNode = childNodes.item(x);
            if(childNode.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
                map.put(childNode.getLocalName(), childNode.getTextContent());
            }
        }
        return map;
    }

}
The AdpatedMap class is where all the magic happens, we will use a DOM to represent the content. We will trick JAXB intro dealing with a DOM through the combination of @XmlAnyElement and a property of type Object:

import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAnyElement;

public class AdaptedMap {

    private Object value;

    @XmlAnyElement
    public Object getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(Object value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

}
This solution requires the MOXy JAXB implementation. You can configure the JAXB runtime to use the MOXy implementation by adding a file named jaxb.properties in with your model classes with the following entry:

javax.xml.bind.context.factory=org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory
The following demo code can be used to verify the code:

import java.io.File;

import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext;
import javax.xml.bind.Marshaller;
import javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller;

public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(Root.class);

        Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jc.createUnmarshaller();
        Root root = (Root) unmarshaller.unmarshal(new File(""src/forum74/input.xml""));

        Marshaller marshaller = jc.createMarshaller();
        marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
        marshaller.marshal(root, System.out);
    }

util,Map,serialize json object which extends map,"<p>If your key is <strong>NOT</strong> guaranteed to be unique for all elements in the list  you should convert it to a <code>
<p>Most of the answers listed miss a case when the <strong>list has duplicate items</strong>.
<p>You can create a Stream of the indices using an IntStream and then convert them to a Map :</p>
<p>I was trying to do this and found that  using the answers above  when using <code>Functions.identity()</code> for the key to the Map  then I had issues with using a local method like <code>this::localMethodName</code> to actually work because of typing issues.</p>
actually does something to the typing in this case so the method would only work by returning <code>Object</code> and accepting a param of <code>Object</code></p>
If you want the map to be mutable  you could copy it again  e.g. using <code>mutableMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(Map.of(&quot;a&quot;  &quot;b&quot;));</code>.
That means the object of the outer class cannot be garbage collected while the created map object is still referenced  thus blocking additional memory</li> </ul> <p>
Using a function for initialization will also enable you to generate a map in an initializer  but avoids nasty side-effects:</p> <pre><code>Map&lt;String  String&gt; myMap = createMap();
As of 2021  Java has no Map literals (yet - I think they were proposed for Java 8  but didn t make it).</p> <p>
(By the way  a map can t contain twice the same value  your second put will overwrite the first one.
map is an instance variable  put the initialization in a constructor or instance initializer:</p> <pre><code>
If you want your map to never change  you should after the initialization wrap your map by <code>Collections.
The map (a collection of entries) is immutable  so you cannot add or remove entries after instantiating.
Also  the key and the value of each entry is immutable  cannot be changed.
See the Javadoc</a> for other rules  such as no NULLs allowed  no duplicate keys allowed  and the iteration order of mappings is arbitrary.</p> <p>
Pass an existing map  get back an immutable copy of that map.</p> <p>
For efficiency  if the passed map is already truly immutable  the <code>copyOf</code>
method produces a <em>view</em> onto the original map  a mere wrapper  not a true copy.
If the original map gets modified (<code>put</code>  <code>remove</code>  etc.)  the supposedly-unmodifiable will actually show the modification.
We see that the supposedly unmodifiable is indeed modifiable <em>indirectly</em>  by modifying the original map on which the unmodifiable map is a view.</li> <li>In contrast  the <code>copyOf</code>
An alternative way to get a map with null values using a builder syntax on Java 8 is writing a custom collector <strong>backed by a HashMap</strong>
The utility class isn t limited neither regarding the type of keys and values nor regarding the amount of entries nor regarding the type of the resulting Map.</p> <p>","I came up with this solution:

public class ArrayToMapDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer<SortedMap<Object, Object>>
    implements ContextualDeserializer {

    private Class<?> keyAs;

    private Class<?> contentAs;

    @Override
    public Map<Object, Object> deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt)
        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {
        return this.deserialize(p, ctxt, new HashMap<>());
    }

    @Override
    public Map<Object, Object> deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt,
        Map<Object, Object> intoValue) throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {
        JsonNode node = p.readValueAsTree();
        ObjectCodec codec = p.getCodec();
        if (node.isArray()) {
            node.forEach(entry -> {
                try {
                    JsonNode keyNode = entry.get(0);
                    JsonNode valueNode = entry.get(1);
                    intoValue.put(keyNode.traverse(codec).readValueAs(this.keyAs),
                        valueNode.traverse(codec).readValueAs(this.contentAs));
                } catch (NullPointerException | IOException e) {
                    // skip entry
                }
            });
        }
        return intoValue;
    }

    @Override
    public JsonDeserializer<?> createContextual(DeserializationContext ctxt, BeanProperty property)
        throws JsonMappingException {
        JsonDeserialize jsonDeserialize = property.getAnnotation(JsonDeserialize.class);
        this.keyAs = jsonDeserialize.keyAs();
        this.contentAs = jsonDeserialize.contentAs();
        return this;
    }

}
which can be used like this:

public class Baz {

    @JsonSerialize(using = MapToArraySerializer.class)
    @JsonDeserialize(using = ArrayToMapDeserializer.class,
        keyAs = Foo.class, contentAs = Bar.class)
    Map<Foo, Bar> map;

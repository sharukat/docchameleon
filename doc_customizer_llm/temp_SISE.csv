grab any element in constant time.\nBut adding or removing from anywhere but the end requires shifting all the latter elements over  either to make an opening or fill the gap.\nIterating over either kind of List is practically equally cheap.\nIn an array list  the remainder of the array needs to be <em>moved</em> (i.e. copied).\nthe desired position can be computed mathematically and accessed in <em>O(1)</em>.</p> <p>\nAnother benefit of using a <code>LinkedList</code> arises when you add or remove from the head of the list  since those operations are <em>O(1)</em>  while they are <em>O(n)</em> for <code>ArrayList</code>.\nLinkedList</code> for adding and removing from the head  but it is not a <code>List</code>.</p> <p>\nAlso  if you have large lists  keep in mind that memory usage is also different.\nEach element of a <code>LinkedList</code> has more overhead since pointers to the next and previous elements are also stored.\nThe default initial capacity of an <code>ArrayList</code> is pretty small (10 from Java 1.4 - 1.8).\nBut since the underlying implementation is an array  the array must be resized if you add a lot of elements.\nTo avoid the high cost of resizing when you know you re going to add a lot of elements  construct the <code>ArrayList</code>\nIf the data structures perspective is used to understand the two structures  a LinkedList is basically a sequential data structure which contains a head Node.\nThe Node is a wrapper for two components : a value of type T [accepted through generics] and another reference to the Node linked to it.\nAddition of elements takes linear time in LinkedList as stated above.</p> <p>An ArrayList is a growable array.\nUnder the hood  when an element is added  and the ArrayList is already full to capacity  it creates another array with a size which is greater than previous size.\nThe elements are then copied from previous array to new one and the elements that are to be added are also placed at the specified indices.</p>\n<p>Thus far  nobody seems to have addressed the memory footprint of each of these lists besides the general consensus that a <code>LinkedList</code> is  lots more  than an <code>ArrayList</code>\nIn practice  the capacity of the backing array in an <code>ArrayList</code> is generally larger than its current element count.</p>\nAs CompressedOops is default now from mid JDK6 and up  the values below for 64-bit machines will basically match their 32-bit counterparts  unless of course you specifically turn it off.</p>\n<p>The result clearly shows that <code>LinkedList</code> is a whole lot more than <code>ArrayList</code>  especially with a very high element count.\nNote the reason for the mods is because all objects in java will take up a multiple of 8 bytes space regardless of whether it is all used or not.</p>\nAny indexed operation requires a traversal  i.e. has O(n) performance.\nThis is not obvious in the source code  leading to algorithms O(n) slower than if <code>ArrayList</code> was used.</li> <li>\n<p>ArrayLists are good for write-once-read-many or appenders  but bad at add/remove from the front or middle.</p>\nAs someone who has been doing operational performance engineering on very large scale SOA web services for about a decade  I would prefer the behavior of LinkedList over ArrayList.\nWhile the steady-state throughput of LinkedList is worse and therefore might lead to buying more hardware -- the behavior of ArrayList under pressure could lead to apps in a cluster expanding their arrays in near synchronicity and for large array sizes could lead to lack of responsiveness in the app and an outage  while under pressure  which is catastrophic behavior.</p>\n<p>Similarly  you can get better throughput in an app from the default throughput tenured garbage collector  but once you get java apps with 10GB heaps you can wind up locking up the app for 25 seconds during a Full GCs which causes timeouts and failures in SOA apps and blows your SLAs if it occurs too often.\nEven though the CMS collector takes more resources and does not achieve the same raw throughput  it is a much better choice because it has more predictable and smaller latency.</p> <p>\nArrayList is only a better choice for performance if all you mean by performance is throughput and you can ignore latency.\nI d like to add that ArrayList will optimize for sequential reading of memory and minimize cache-line and TLB misses  etc.\nThe copying overhead when the array grows past the bounds is likely inconsequential by comparison (and can be done by efficient CPU operations).\nThe only situations where a LinkedList might make sense would be something highly contrived where you had thousands of Lists any one of which might grow to be GB-sized  but where no good guess could be made at allocation-time of the List and setting them all to GB-sized would blow up the heap.\nAnd if you found some problem like that  then it really does call for reengineering whatever your solution is (and I don t like to lightly suggest reengineering old code because I myself maintain piles and piles of old code  but that d be a very good case of where the original design has simply run out of runway and does need to be chucked).\nThere are some very specific algorithms where a LinkedList is called for  but those are very  very rare and the algorithm will usually specifically depend on LinkedList s ability to insert and delete elements in the middle of the list relatively quickly  once you ve navigated there with a ListIterator.</p>\n<p>There is one common use case in which LinkedList outperforms ArrayList: that of a queue.\nHowever  if your goal is performance  instead of LinkedList you should also consider using an ArrayBlockingQueue (if you can determine an upper bound on your queue size ahead of time  and can afford to allocate all the memory up front)  or this <a href=

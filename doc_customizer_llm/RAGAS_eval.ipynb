(deprecated arguments)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n<pre class=\\\\\"devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-py tfo-signature-link\\\\\">\\\\n<code>tf.gather(\\\\n    params, indices, validate_indices=None, axis=None, batch_dims=0, name=None\\\\n)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n<!-- Placeholder for \\\\\"Used in\\\\\" -->\\\\n\\\\nDeprecated: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(validate_indices)`. They will be removed in a future version.\\\\nInstructions for updating:\\\\nThe `validate_indices` argument has no effect. Indices are always validated on CPU and never validated on GPU.\\\\n\\\\nGather slices from `params` axis `axis` according to `indices`.  `indices`\\\\nmust be an integer tensor of any dimension (often 1-D).\\\\n\\\\n<a href=\\\\\"../tf/Tensor.md#__getitem__\\\\\"><code>Tensor.__getitem__</code></a> works for scalars, <a href=\\\\\"../tf.md#newaxis\\\\\"><code>tf.newaxis</code></a>, and\\\\n[python slices](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html#basic-slicing-and-indexing)\\\\n\\\\n<a href=\\\\\"../tf/gather.md\\\\\"><code>tf.gather</code></a> extends indexing to handle tensors of indices.\\\\n\\\\nIn the simplest case it\\'s identical to scalar indexing:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> params = tf.constant([\\'p0\\', \\'p1\\', \\'p2\\', \\'p3\\', \\'p4\\', \\'p5\\'])\\\\n>>> params[3].numpy()\\\\nb\\'p3\\'\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, 3).numpy()\\\\nb\\'p3\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe most common case is to pass a single axis tensor of indices (this\\\\ncan\\'t be expressed as a python slice because the indices are not sequential):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> indices = [2, 0, 2, 5]\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices).numpy()\\\\narray([b\\'p2\\', b\\'p0\\', b\\'p2\\', b\\'p5\\'], dtype=object)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<div style=\\\\\"width:70%; margin:auto; margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:20px;\\\\\">\\\\n<img style=\\\\\"width:100%\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/Gather.png\\\\\"\\\\nalt>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\nThe indices can have any shape. When the `params` has 1 axis, the\\\\noutput shape is equal to the input shape:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, [[2, 0], [2, 5]]).numpy()\\\\narray([[b\\'p2\\', b\\'p0\\'],\\\\n       [b\\'p2\\', b\\'p5\\']], dtype=object)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe `params` may also have any shape. `gather` can select slices\\\\nacross any axis depending on the `axis` argument (which defaults to 0).\\\\nBelow it is used to gather first rows, then columns from a matrix:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> params = tf.constant([[0, 1.0, 2.0],\\\\n...                       [10.0, 11.0, 12.0],\\\\n...                       [20.0, 21.0, 22.0],\\\\n...                       [30.0, 31.0, 32.0]])\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices=[3,1]).numpy()\\\\narray([[30., 31., 32.],\\\\n       [10., 11., 12.]], dtype=float32)\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices=[2,1], axis=1).numpy()\\\\narray([[ 2.,  1.],\\\\n       [12., 11.],\\\\n       [22., 21.],\\\\n       [32., 31.]], dtype=float32)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nMore generally: The output shape has the same shape as the input, with the\\\\nindexed-axis replaced by the shape of the indices.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> def result_shape(p_shape, i_shape, axis=0):\\\\n...   return p_shape[:axis] + i_shape + p_shape[axis+1:]\\\\n>>>\\\\n>>> result_shape([1, 2, 3], [], axis=1)\\\\n[1, 3]\\\\n>>> result_shape([1, 2, 3], [7], axis=1)\\\\n[1, 7, 3]\\\\n>>> result_shape([1, 2, 3], [7, 5], axis=1)\\\\n[1, 7, 5, 3]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHere are some examples:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> params.shape.as_list()\\\\n[4, 3]\\\\n>>> indices = tf.constant([[0, 2]])\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices=indices, axis=0).shape.as_list()\\\\n[1, 2, 3]\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices=indices, axis=1).shape.as_list()\\\\n[4, 1, 2]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> params = tf.random.normal(shape=(5, 6, 7, 8))\\\\n>>> indices = tf.random.uniform(shape=(10, 11), maxval=7, dtype=tf.int32)\\\\n>>> result = tf.gather(params, indices, axis=2)\\\\n>>> result.shape.as_list()\\\\n[5, 6, 10, 11, 8]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis is because each index takes a slice from `params`, and\\\\nplaces it at the corresponding location in the output. For the above example\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> # For any location in indices\\\\n>>> a, b = 0, 1\\\\n>>> tf.reduce_all(\\\\n...     # the corresponding slice of the result\\\\n...     result[:, :, a, b, :] ==\\\\n...     # is equal to the slice of `params` along `axis` at the index.\\\\n...     params[:, :, indices[a, b], :]\\\\n... ).numpy()\\\\nTrue\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Batching:\\\\n\\\\nThe `batch_dims` argument lets you gather different items from each element\\\\nof a batch.\\\\n\\\\nUsing `batch_dims=1` is equivalent to having an outer loop over the first\\\\naxis of `params` and `indices`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> params = tf.constant([\\\\n...     [0, 0, 1, 0, 2],\\\\n...     [3, 0, 0, 0, 4],\\\\n...     [0, 5, 0, 6, 0]])\\\\n>>> indices = tf.constant([\\\\n...     [2, 4],\\\\n...     [0, 4],\\\\n...     [1, 3]])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices, axis=1, batch_dims=1).numpy()\\\\narray([[1, 2],\\\\n       [3, 4],\\\\n       [5, 6]], dtype=int32)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### This is equivalent to:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> def manually_batched_gather(params, indices, axis):\\\\n...   batch_dims=1\\\\n...   result = []\\\\n...   for p,i in zip(params, indices):\\\\n...     r = tf.gather(p, i, axis=axis-batch_dims)\\\\n...     result.append(r)\\\\n...   return tf.stack(result)\\\\n>>> manually_batched_gather(params, indices, axis=1).numpy()\\\\narray([[1, 2],\\\\n       [3, 4],\\\\n       [5, 6]], dtype=int32)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHigher values of `batch_dims` are equivalent to multiple nested loops over\\\\nthe outer axes of `params` and `indices`. So the overall shape function is\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> def batched_result_shape(p_shape, i_shape, axis=0, batch_dims=0):\\\\n...   return p_shape[:axis] + i_shape[batch_dims:] + p_shape[axis+1:]\\\\n>>>\\\\n>>> batched_result_shape(\\\\n...     p_shape=params.shape.as_list(),\\\\n...     i_shape=indices.shape.as_list(),\\\\n...     axis=1,\\\\n...     batch_dims=1)\\\\n[3, 2]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n>>> tf.gather(params, indices, axis=1, batch_dims=1).shape.as_list()\\\\n[3, 2]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis comes up naturally if you need to use the indices of an operation like\\\\n<a href=\\\\\"../tf/argsort.md\\\\\"><code>tf.argsort</code></a>, or <a href=\\\\\"../tf/math/top_k.md\\\\\"><code>tf.math.top_k</code></a> where the last dimension of the indices\\\\nindexes into the last dimension of input, at the corresponding location.\\\\nIn this case you can use `tf.gather(values, indices, batch_dims=-1)`.\\\\n\\\\n#### See also:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n* <a href=\\\\\"../tf/Tensor.md#__getitem__\\\\\"><code>tf.Tensor.__getitem__</code></a>: The direct tensor index operation (`t[]`), handles\\\\n  scalars and python-slices `tensor[..., 7, 1:-1]`\\\\n* `tf.scatter`: A collection of operations similar to `__setitem__`\\\\n  (`t[i] = x`)\\\\n* <a href=\\\\\"../tf/gather_nd.md\\\\\"><code>tf.gather_nd</code></a>: An operation similar to <a href=\\\\\"../tf/gather.md\\\\\"><code>tf.gather</code></a> but gathers across\\\\n  multiple axis at once (it can gather elements of a matrix instead of rows\\\\n  or columns)\\\\n* <a href=\\\\\"../tf/boolean_mask.md\\\\\"><code>tf.boolean_mask</code></a>, <a href=\\\\\"../tf/where.md\\\\\"><code>tf.where</code></a>: Binary indexing.\\\\n* <a href=\\\\\"../tf/slice.md\\\\\"><code>tf.slice</code></a> and <a href=\\\\\"../tf/strided_slice.md\\\\\"><code>tf.strided_slice</code></a>: For lower level access to the\\\\n  implementation of `__getitem__`\\'s python-slice handling (`t[1:-1:2]`)\\\\n\\\\n<!-- Tabular view -->\\\\n <table class=\\\\\"responsive fixed orange\\\\\">\\\\n<colgroup><col width=\\\\\"214px\\\\\"><col></colgroup>\\\\n<tr><th colspan=\\\\\"2\\\\\"><h2 class=\\\\\"add-link\\\\\">Args</h2></th></tr>\\\\n\\\\n<tr>\\\\n<td>\\\\n`params`<a id=\\\\\"params\\\\\"></a>\\\\n</td>\\\\n<td>\\\\nThe `Tensor` from which to gather values.

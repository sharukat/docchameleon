",HumanEval/13,"To complete the function `greatest_common_divisor`, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The steps are as follows: 1. If `b` is 0, then the GCD is `a`. 2. Otherwise, set `a` to `b` and `b` to `a % b`, and repeat the process. This will eventually result in `b` being 0, at which point `a` will be the GCD. This method is efficient and works in O(log(min(a, b))) time complexity.

<p>The docs mention that the input image must be of shape <code>[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]</code> and the kernel must be of shape <code>[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]</code>. However, what is the most straightforward way to achieve 2D convolution with input shape <code>[in_height, in_width, in_channels]</code>?</p>

<p>Here is an example of the current approach, where <code>img</code> has shape (height, width, channels):</p>

<pre><code>img = tf.random_uniform((10,10,3))  # a single image

To apply the `tf.nn.conv2d()` function to a single image instead of a batch of images, you indeed need to adjust the shape of your input image to match the expected input shape of `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`. However, TensorFlow provides a more elegant way to add a batch dimension to your image without explicitly reshaping it as you've done. You can use the `tf.expand_dims()` function to add a new axis, effectively transforming your image into a batch of one. This method is more readable and directly conveys the intention of adding a batch dimension.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assuming img has shape (height, width, channels)
img = tf.random.uniform((10, 10, 3), dtype=tf.float32)

# Use tf.expand_dims to add the batch dimension
img_batch = tf.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

# Define your kernel/filter here. Example:
kernel = tf.random.uniform((3, 3, 3, 8), dtype=tf.float32)  # Example kernel

# Apply tf.nn.conv2d
output = tf.nn.conv2d(img_batch, kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID')

# If needed, remove the batch dimension to get back to the original shape
output_img = tf.squeeze(output, axis=0)

print(output_img.shape)
```

In this example, `tf.expand_dims(img, axis=0)` adds a new dimension at the start, effectively making the shape of `img_batch` as `[1, height, width, channels]`, which is suitable for `tf.nn.conv2d()`. After the convolution, if you want to revert to the original shape (without the batch dimension), you can use `tf.squeeze(output, axis=0)`, which removes dimensions of size 1 from the shape of the tensor.

This approach is standard and recommended when dealing with operations that expect a batch dimension, even when you're only processing a single image or data point.

To address your question about using `tf.while_loop` with a condition dependent on a tensor computed in the loop body, you can indeed achieve this by ensuring that the tensor you want to condition on is returned by the body function and passed as one of the loop variables. This way, the condition function can depend on the value computed inside the loop.

Here's how you can structure your code to use `tf.while_loop` for your specific use case of discarding low-quality image crops and trying new random crops until a sufficient quality example is obtained:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Define your image and crop shapes
IMAGE_SHAPE = [960, 720]
CROP_SHAPE = [320, 240]

# Initial values for loop variables
img = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, None])  # Placeholder for your input image
initial_img_crop = tf.zeros([320, 240, 3])  # Initial dummy value for img_crop

def body(crop_begin_index, img_crop):
    max_begin_index = np.array(IMAGE_SHAPE) - np.array(CROP_SHAPE)
    crop_begin_index = tf.round(tf.random.uniform([2]) * max_begin_index)
    img_crop = tf.slice(img, tf.cast(crop_begin_index, tf.int32), CROP_SHAPE + [-1])
    return crop_begin_index, img_crop

def cond(crop_begin_index, img_crop):
    return tf.less(tf.count_nonzero(img_crop > 0), 0.5 * tf.size(img_crop, out_type=tf.int64))

# Execute the while loop
_, img_crop_final = tf.while_loop(cond, body, [tf.zeros([2], tf.float32), initial_img_crop])

# Note: You'll need to run this within a TensorFlow session and feed an actual image to `img`
```

This code snippet initializes `img_crop` with a dummy value and updates it within the loop body based on random cropping. The condition checks if the number of non-zero pixels in the cropped image is less than half of the total number of pixels, indicating a low-quality crop. If the condition is true, the loop continues, trying another random crop until a sufficient quality example is obtained.

Remember, you'll need to run this within a TensorFlow session, and you must feed an actual image to the `img` placeholder. Also, ensure that TensorFlow 1.x is being used or adapt the code using `tf.compat.v1` if you're working with TensorFlow 2.x, as `tf.placeholder` and `tf.while_loop` might behave differently or be deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x.

The error you're encountering, `The last dimension of the inputs to Dense should be defined. Found None.`, typically occurs when the model's layers cannot infer the shapes they're supposed to work with, especially when transitioning from convolutional layers to dense layers. This is a common issue when converting models from `keras` to `tf.keras`, as the latter may handle tensor shapes slightly differently.

To resolve this issue, let's address the conversion process step by step, ensuring that each layer correctly understands its input shape. The primary focus will be on the `InputLayer` and `Reshape` layers, as these are crucial for setting up the initial dimensions that flow through the network.

## Corrected `tf.keras` Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correctly define the input layer
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(100,))

# Use the Reshape layer correctly. The -1 in the original code is ambiguous when transitioning to Dense layers.
# Assuming the intention was to keep the same total dimensionality, we avoid using -1 in the reshape target shape.
reshape_layer = tf.keras.layers.Reshape((100, 1, 1))(input_layer)

# Convolutional layers as defined in the original model
conv_layer_1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=30, kernel_size=(10, 1), strides=(1, 1), padding=""same"", activation=""relu"")(reshape_layer)
conv_layer_2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=30, kernel_size=(8, 1), strides=(1, 1), padding=""same"", activation=""relu"")(conv_layer_1)
conv_layer_3 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=40, kernel_size=(6, 1), strides=(1, 1), padding=""same"", activation=""relu"")(conv_layer_2)
conv_layer_4 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=50, kernel_size=(5, 1), strides=(1, 1), padding=""same"", activation=""relu"")(conv_layer_3)
conv_layer_5 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=50, kernel_size=(5, 1), strides=(1, 1), padding=""same"", activation=""relu"")(conv_layer_4)

# Flatten the output of the last convolutional layer before feeding it into Dense layers
flatten_layer = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv_layer_5)

# Dense layers
label_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(200, activation=""relu"")(flatten_layer)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=""linear"")(label_layer)

# Construct the model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Compile the model (optional here, but necessary before training)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Display the model's architecture
model.summary()
```

### Key Changes and Explanations:

- **Input Layer**: Changed from `InputLayer` with `input_shape` to `Input` with `shape`. This is a more conventional way to define input layers in `tf.keras`, ensuring the model starts with a clearly defined input shape.
- **Reshape Layer**: The original use of `-1` in the reshape dimensions can lead to ambiguity, especially when transitioning to dense layers that require a fully defined shape. By specifying `(100, 1, 1)`, we make the input shape explicit for the convolutional layers that follow. This change ensures that the model can infer the correct shape for all layers, including the dense layers at the end of the model.

By making these adjustments, the model should now compile and run without the dimensionality error, allowing you to proceed with training and utilizing `tfmot` as intended.

To automate the process of creating a vocabulary list for a categorical feature column in TensorFlow, especially when dealing with large datasets, you can indeed utilize the `tf.unique` operation to extract unique values from a tensor. Here's how you can apply this to generate `vocabulary_feature_column` dynamically:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example dataset
dataset = {
    'feature_name_from_input_fn': ['kitchenware', 'electronics', 'sports', 'electronics', 'kitchenware']
}

# Convert the dataset to a TensorFlow tensor
feature_tensor = tf.constant(dataset['feature_name_from_input_fn'])

# Use tf.unique to find unique values
y, idx = tf.unique(feature_tensor)

# Convert the unique values tensor to a Python list for the vocabulary list
vocabulary_list = y.numpy().tolist()

# Assuming 'feature_name_from_input_fn' is the key for your feature column
vocabulary_feature_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(
    key=""feature_name_from_input_fn"",
    vocabulary_list=vocabulary_list)

print(""Vocabulary List:"", vocabulary_list)
```

Please note, the `y.numpy().tolist()` part is used to convert the tensor of unique values to a Python list. This step requires eager execution mode in TensorFlow, which is enabled by default in TensorFlow 2.x. If you're using TensorFlow 1.x, you'll need to explicitly start a TensorFlow session to evaluate tensors.

This approach allows you to dynamically create a vocabulary list from your dataset without manually specifying it. This is particularly useful for large datasets with many unique categorical values.

In traditional bucketized columns, each bucket represents a range of values (for example, from 1960 to 1979). In a categorical identity column, each bucket represents a single, unique integer. For example, let\'s say you want to represent the integer range [0, 4). (That is, you want to represent the integers 0, 1, 2, or 3.) In this case, the categorical identity mapping looks like this:\n\nFigure 5. A categorical identity column mapping. Note that this is a one-hot encoding, not a binary numerical encoding.\n\nSo, why would you want to represent values as categorical identity columns? As with bucketized columns, a model can learn a separate weight for each class in a categorical identity column. For example, instead of using a string to represent the product_class, let\'s represent each class with a unique integer value. That is:\n\nCall tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity() to implement a categorical identity column. For example:\n\n# Create a categorical output for input ""feature_name_from_input_fn"", # which must be of integer type. Value is expected to be >= 0 and < num_buckets identity_feature_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity( key=\'feature_name_from_input_fn\', num_buckets=4) # Values [0, 4) # The \'feature_name_from_input_fn\' above needs to match an integer key that is # returned from input_fn (see below). So for this case, \'Integer_1\' or # \'Integer_2\' would be valid strings instead of \'feature_name_from_input_fn\'. # For more information, please check out Part 1 of this blog series. def input_fn(): ...<code>... return ({ \'Integer_1\':[values], ..<etc>.., \'Integer_2\':[values] }, [Label_values])\n\nCategorical vocabulary column\n\nWe cannot input strings directly to a model. Instead, we must first map strings to numeric or categorical values. Categorical vocabulary columns provide a good way to represent strings as a one-hot vector. For example:\n\nFigure 6. Mapping string values to vocabulary columns.\n\nAs you can see, categorical vocabulary columns are kind of an enum version of categorical identity columns. TensorFlow provides two different functions to create categorical vocabulary columns:\n\ntf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list()\n\ntf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file()\n\nThe tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list() function maps each string to an integer based on an explicit vocabulary list. For example:\n\n# Given input ""feature_name_from_input_fn"" which is a string, # create a categorical feature to our model by mapping the input to one of # the elements in the vocabulary list. vocabulary_feature_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list( key=""feature_name_from_input_fn"", vocabulary_list=[""kitchenware"", ""electronics"", ""sports""])\nThe preceding function has a significant drawback; namely, there\'s way too much typing when the vocabulary list is long. For these cases, call tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file() instead, which lets you place the vocabulary words in a separate file. For example:\n\n# Given input ""feature_name_from_input_fn"" which is a string, # create a categorical feature to our model by mapping the input to one of # the elements in the vocabulary file vocabulary_feature_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file( key=""feature_name_from_input_fn"", vocabulary_file=""product_class.txt"", vocabulary_size=3) # product_class.txt should have one line for vocabulary element, in our case: kitchenware electronics sports\n\nUsing hash buckets to limit categories\n\nSo far, we\'ve worked with a naively small number of categories. For example, our product_class example has only 3 categories. Often though, the number of categories can be so big that it\'s not possible to have individual categories for each vocabulary word or integer because that would consume too much memory. For these cases, we can instead turn the question around and ask, ""How many categories am I willing to have for my input?"" In fact, the tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_buckets() function enables you to specify the number of categories. For example, the following code shows how this function calculates a hash value of the input, then puts it into one of the hash_bucket_size categories using the modulo operator:\n\n# Create categorical output for input ""feature_name_from_input_fn"". # Category becomes: hash_value(""feature_name_from_input_fn"") % hash_bucket_size hashed_feature_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_bucket( key = ""feature_name_from_input_fn"", hash_buckets_size = 100) # The number of categories\n\nAt this point, you might rightfully think: ""This is crazy!"" After all, we are forcing the different input values to a smaller set of categories. This means that two, probably completely unrelated inputs, will be mapped to the same category, and consequently mean the same thing to the neural network. Figure 7 illustrates this dilemma, showing that kitchenware and sports both get assigned to category (hash bucket) 12:\n\nFigure 7. Representing data in hash buckets.\n\nAs with many counterintuitive phenomena in machine learning, it turns out that hashing often works well in practice. That\'s because hash categories provide the model with some separation. The model can use additional features to further separate kitchenware from sports.\n\nThe last categorical column we\'ll cover allows us to combine multiple input features into a single one. Combining features, better known as feature crosses, enables the model to learn separate weights specifically for whatever that feature combination means.\nHow to represent categorical columns in TensorFlow.\n\nHow do we represent categorical columns?\n\nIn TensorFlow, you can represent categorical columns in various ways depending on the type of categorical data you’re dealing with. Here are some common techniques for encoding categorical columns in TensorFlow :\n\nOne-Hot Encoding (tf.one_hot):\n\nOne-hot encoding is a common method for converting categorical values into a binary matrix. Each category is represented as a unique binary vector, where only one element is “hot” (1), and the rest are “cold” (0).\n\nTensorFlow provides the tf.one_hot function to perform one-hot encoding. Here\'s an example of how to use it:\n\nimport tensorflow as tf # Define the categorical column as a list of category labels categorical_column = [\'category_a\', \'category_b\', \'category_c\'] # Perform one-hot encoding one_hot_encoded = tf.one_hot(categorical_column, depth=len(categorical_column))\n\n2. Embedding Layers (tf.keras.layers.Embedding):\n\nWhen dealing with high-cardinality categorical columns (those with many unique categories), one-hot encoding can result in a very large and sparse input. In such cases, using an embedding layer can be more efficient.\n\nAn embedding layer maps each category to a dense vector of lower dimensionality. These embeddings are learned during the training process.\n\nHere’s an example of how to use an embedding layer in TensorFlow:\n\nimport tensorflow as tf # Define the input layer with categorical values as integers input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,)) # Define the embedding layer embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=num_categories, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)\n\n3. Integer Encoding:\n\nIn some cases, you might choose to represent categorical values as integers, especially when using traditional machine learning models. You can use integer encoding to map each category to a unique integer.\n\nTensorFlow doesn’t provide a specific function for this, but you can perform integer encoding using Python and NumPy.\n\nimport numpy as np # Define the categorical column as a list of category labels categorical_column = [\'category_a\', \'category_b\', \'category_c\'] # Create a mapping from category to integer category_to_int = {category: i for i, category in enumerate(categorical_column)} # Perform integer encoding integer_encoded = [category_to_int[category] for category in categorical_column]\n\n4. Categorical Feature Columns (tf.feature_column):\n\nTensorFlow provides the tf.feature_column module, which offers a high-level API for handling various types of feature columns, including categorical columns.\n\nYou can create categorical feature columns using tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list or tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_bucket.\n\nThe vocabulary_list is a list of unique category labels that represent the possible values of a categorical feature. Each element in the list corresponds to a category']","The user is seeking a method to automatically generate a vocabulary list for a TensorFlow categorical feature column from a dataset with many unique values, rather than manually specifying the vocabulary list."
59361689,tf.keras.backend,Documentation Replication on Other Examples,Redundancies in tf.keras.backend and tensorflow libraries,"<p>I have been working in TensorFlow for about a year now, and I am transitioning from TF 1.x to TF 2.0, and I am looking for some guidance on how to use the <code>tf.keras.backend</code> library in TF 2.0. I understand that the transition to TF 2.0 is supposed to remove a lot of redundancies in modeling and building graphs, since there were many ways to create equivalent layers in earlier TensorFlow versions (and I'm insanely grateful for that change!), but I'm getting stuck on understanding when to use <code>tf.keras.backend</code>, because the operations appear redundant with other TensorFlow libraries. </p>

<p>I see that some of the functions in <code>tf.keras.backend</code> are redundant with other TensorFlow libraries. For instance, <code>tf.keras.backend.abs</code> and <code>tf.math.abs</code> are not aliases (or at least, they're not listed as aliases in the documentation), but both take the absolute value of a tensor. After examining the source code, it looks like <code>tf.keras.backend.abs</code> calls the <code>tf.math.abs</code> function, and so I really do not understand why they are not aliases. Other <code>tf.keras.backend</code> operations don't appear to be duplicated in TensorFlow libraries, but it looks like there are TensorFlow functions that can do equivalent things. For instance, <code>tf.keras.backend.cast_to_floatx</code> can be substituted with <code>tf.dtypes.cast</code> as long as you explicitly specify the dtype. I am wondering two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>when is it best to use the <code>tf.keras.backend</code> library instead of the equivalent TensorFlow functions?</li>
<li>is there a difference in these functions (and other equivalent <code>tf.keras.backend</code> functions) that I am missing?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Short answer: Prefer tensorflow's native API such as <code>tf.math.*</code> to the<code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> API wherever possible.</p>

<p>Longer answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> API can be <em>mostly</em> viewed as a remnant of the <code>keras.backend.*</code> API. The latter is a design that serves the ""exchangeable backend"" design of the original (non-TF-specific) keras. This relates to the historical aspect of keras, which supports multiple backend libraries, among which tensorflow used to be just one of them. Back in 2015 and 2016, other backends, such as Theano and MXNet were quite popular too. But going into 2017 and 2018, tensorflow became the dominant backend of keras users. Eventually keras became a part of the tensorflow API (in 2.x and later minor versions of 1.x). In the old multi-backend world, the <code>backend.*</code> API provides a backend-independent abstraction over the myriad of supported backend. But in the tf.keras world, the value of the backend API is much more limited.</li>
<li>The various functions in <code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> can be divided into a few categories:

<ol>
<li>Thin wrappers around the equivalent or mostly-equivalent tensorflow native API. Examples: <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L2363"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.less</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L2431"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.sin</a></li>
<li>Slightly thicker wrappers around tensorflow native APIs, with more features included. Examples: <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L2589"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.batch_normalization</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4869"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.conv2d</a>(<a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4869"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4869</a>). They often perform proprocessing and implement other logics, which make your life easier than using native tensorflow API.</li>

","# Customized Content

Understanding when to use `tf.keras.backend` functions over TensorFlow's native functions can be a bit confusing, especially when transitioning from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.0. The `tf.keras.backend` module provides a set of functions that abstract away differences between different backends, such as TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. However, with TensorFlow 2.0, Keras has been integrated more deeply into TensorFlow, and `tf.keras` has become the recommended API for developing models, which might raise questions about the necessity and use cases of `tf.keras.backend`.

To address your questions:

1. **When is it best to use the `tf.keras.backend` library instead of the equivalent TensorFlow functions?**

   It's generally best to use TensorFlow's native functions (e.g., `tf.math.abs`, `tf.dtypes.cast`) for operations that have direct equivalents in the TensorFlow API. These functions are more likely to be optimized for performance and might integrate better with TensorFlow's ecosystem and future updates.

   However, `tf.keras.backend` functions can be particularly useful when writing code that needs to be backend-agnostic, meaning it could run on top of different deep learning frameworks that Keras supports (or supported). This is less relevant now that Keras is tightly integrated with TensorFlow, but it can still be useful for code that was written with this in mind or for maintaining compatibility with older Keras code.

2. **Is there a difference in these functions (and other equivalent `tf.keras.backend` functions) that I am missing?**

   Many `tf.keras.backend` functions are indeed wrappers around TensorFlow operations, designed to provide a unified interface that was backend-agnostic. While they might perform the same operations as their TensorFlow counterparts, the key difference was in their ability to switch backends. With the current focus on TensorFlow, this distinction is less critical. However, some `tf.keras.backend` functions might include additional logic or preprocessing steps that are specific to neural network model development, making them more convenient in certain contexts.

To illustrate the use of `tf.keras.backend` and its relation to TensorFlow's native functions, let's replicate an example from the documentation, focusing on a function that demonstrates the backend's utility in neural network operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example of using tf.keras.backend function
def custom_activation(x):
    return tf.keras.backend.relu(x, alpha=0.0, max_value=None, threshold=0.0)

# Equivalent operation using TensorFlow's native function
def custom_activation_tf(x):
    return tf.nn.relu(x)

# Test data
x = tf.constant([-3.0, -1.5, 0.0, 1.5, 3.0])

# Applying the custom activation functions
y_keras_backend = custom_activation(x)
y_tensorflow = custom_activation_tf(x)

print(""Output using tf.keras.backend:"", y_keras_backend.numpy())
print(""Output using TensorFlow native function:"", y_tensorflow.numpy())
```

In this example, we define a custom activation function using both `tf.keras.backend.relu` and TensorFlow's native `tf.nn.relu`. While both functions achieve the same result for this specific operation, using `tf.keras.backend` might offer additional parameters or behaviors that are consistent across different backends, which was more relevant when Keras supported multiple backends.

It just so happens that Keras has proven to be the most popular among the community. As a result, TensorFlow has adapted to the extent that Keras is now the default API in TensorFlow 2.0.\n\nOne of the biggest changes is the way libraries are now loaded using tf.keras.\n\nConsider this example. Let\'s say one wishes to run a Sequential model using Keras. To do so, one must import the relevant libraries.\n\nIn the first version of TensorFlow, it would be done as follows:\n\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Dense from tensorflow.python.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor\n\nThe model is defined as such:\n\nmodel = Sequential() model.add(Dense(8, activation=\'relu\', input_shape=(4,))) model.add(Dense(1, activation=\'sigmoid\'))\n\nNow, let\'s contrast this to the TensorFlow 2.0 notation:\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras import models from tensorflow.keras import layers model = models.Sequential() model.add(layers.Dense(8, activation=\'relu\', input_shape=(4,))) model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation=\'sigmoid\'))\n\nThe Sequential function is now being defined using models, and layers is the only other library imported. Whereas in TensorFlow v1.0, Sequential, Dense, and KerasRegressor all had to be imported separately to generate the model.\n\nUsing the above example as a reference point, one can say that Keras now uses TensorFlow as a backend most frequently - simply because it has proven to be the most popular. As a result, TensorFlow has adapted to making the syntax for calling Keras more user-friendly, and thus Keras has become the default API in v2.0.\n\nYou might also find this article of use for further information on this topic: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/10/21/keras-vs-tf-keras-whats-the-difference-in-tensorflow-2-0/\n\nedited Jan 2, 2020 at 22:35\n\nanswered Jan 2, 2020 at 17:47\n\nMichael GroganMichael Grogan\n\n58722 silver badges77 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1\n\n$\\begingroup$ i can write a simple neural network with keras .

The goal was to create an abstraction layer to make Theano easier to use, enabling fast prototyping.\n\nAugust 2015 Google hires François Chollet.\n\nNovember 2015 Tensorflow is released by Google, with much inspiration from Theano and its declarative computational graph paradigm.\n\nDecember 2015 Keras is refactored to allow for pluggable backend engines, and now it offers backend implementations for Theano and Tensorflow.\n\nOther backends were later supported by Keras (CNTK, MxNet), but they never got much traction.\n\nTime passes by and the overlap between Tensorflow and Keras grows.

Tensorflow was a bit difficult to use, and Keras simplified it a lot.\n\nLater, Tensorflow incorporated many functionalities similar to Keras\'. Keras became less necessary.\n\nThen, apart from the multi-backend version, Keras was bundled with Tensorflow. Their separation line blurred over the years.\n\nThe multi-backend Keras version was discontinued. Now the only Keras is the one bundled with Tensorflow.\n\nUpdate: the relationship between Keras and Tensorflow is best understood with an example:\n\nThe dependency between Keras and Tensorflow is internal to Keras, it is not exposed to the programmer working with Keras. For example, in the source code of Keras, there is an implementation of a convolutional layer; this implementation calls package keras.backend to actually run the convolution computation; depending on the Keras configuration file, this backend is set to use the Tensorflow backend implementation in keras.backend.tensorflow_backend.py; this Keras file just invokes Tensorflow to compute the convolution\n\nUpdate 2: new important events in the timeline:\n\nAugust 2021: Tensorflow 2.6.0 no longer has Keras as part of it.

","Based on your description, it seems you are correctly using `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` to create a TensorFlow dataset from a generator that yields data with variable rows and a fixed number of columns (500 columns in your case), along with labels. Your use of `tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None, 512), dtype=tf.float32)` for the data and `tf.TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.int64)` for the labels is almost correct, except for the mismatch in the number of columns (512 vs. 500 as mentioned in your question). 

To address your specific question about using `None` for the number of rows: yes, it is correct to use `None` in the `shape` argument of `tf.TensorSpec` for dimensions that are variable. In your case, using `None` for the number of rows allows the dataset to handle batches of data where the number of rows can vary between batches.

However, you should correct the number of columns to match your description (500 columns). Here's how you can define the `output_signature`:

```python
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
   datagen_row,
   output_signature=(
      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None, 500), dtype=tf.float32, name=None),  # Corrected to 500 columns
      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.int64, name=None)
   )
)
```

This `output_signature` tells TensorFlow that your dataset will produce batches of data where each batch consists of two parts: 

1. A floating-point tensor with a variable number of rows and 500 columns.
2. An integer tensor with a scalar value (representing the label).

By specifying `None` for the first dimension (number of rows) in your data tensor, you correctly indicate that this dimension can vary, allowing for flexibility in the size of your batches.

","# Customized Content

In TensorFlow, a trainable parameter refers to variables that the training process can modify. The `trainable` argument in the `tf.compat.v1.layers.batch_normalization` function specifies whether the layer's variables (gamma and beta) should be considered as trainable parameters. When set to `True`, these variables are added to the collection `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`, making them subject to optimization during the training process.

The moving averages (moving mean and moving variance) are not considered trainable parameters because they are not directly optimized during training. Instead, they are updated through a different mechanism that computes their new values based on the current batch's statistics. Therefore, setting the `trainable` flag to `True` or `False` does not affect the moving averages; it only affects whether gamma and beta are trainable.

Here's a simple example to illustrate how to use `tf.compat.v1.layers.batch_normalization` with the `trainable` parameter:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder for inputs
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1])

# Batch normalization layer
x_norm = tf.compat.v1.layers.batch_normalization(x, training=True, trainable=True)

# Define the optimizer and training operation
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

# Update operations for moving averages
update_ops = tf.compat.v1.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)
train_op = tf.group([train_op, update_ops])

# Now, `train_op` will update beta and gamma if they are trainable,
# as well as the moving averages.
```

In this example, the batch normalization layer is configured with `trainable=True`, meaning that the gamma and beta parameters will be updated during training. The moving averages are updated separately through the `update_ops` mechanism, which is necessary for the batch normalization to function correctly during both training and inference.

To pad a 1-dimensional vector in TensorFlow and resolve the `InvalidArgumentError` you encountered, you need to correctly format the `paddings` argument as a 2D tensor that specifies how many values to add before and after the tensor in each dimension. Since you're working with a 1-dimensional vector and want to pad it to a length of 20 with values of 10, you'll need to calculate the padding required at the beginning and end of the vector.

Given your vector `[1, 2, 3, 45]`, it has a length of 4. To pad it to a length of 20, you need to add 16 values. If you want to evenly distribute the padding, you can add 8 values at the beginning and 8 at the end. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original vector
vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 45])

# Calculate padding
total_length = 20  # Desired length
current_length = tf.size(vector)
padding_size = total_length - current_length
padding_before = padding_size // 2
padding_after = padding_size - padding_before

# Apply padding
padded_vector = tf.pad(vector, [[padding_before, padding_after]], constant_values=10)

print(padded_vector)
```

This code snippet first calculates how much padding is needed to reach the desired length of 20. It then divides this padding size into two parts to add before and after the original vector. Finally, it uses `tf.pad` with the calculated paddings and a `constant_values` of 10 to pad the vector.

Remember, the `paddings` argument in `tf.pad` requires a 2D tensor where the first column is the padding before and the second column is the padding after, for each dimension of the input tensor. Since your vector is 1-dimensional, `paddings` should be of shape `[1, 2]`.

Yes, your understanding is correct regarding the behavior of `tf.keras.layers.Dense` for inputs with a rank greater than 2. The `Dense` layer indeed uses a single kernel to operate across the last axis of the input tensor, applying the same kernel to each slice along the second-to-last dimension. This means that the outputs for different indices of the second dimension are not independent of each other, as they all share the same kernel during the operation.

To use a stack of kernels instead, thereby allowing for independent operations across the second dimension of the input tensor, you would indeed need to implement a custom layer. This custom layer would involve creating a kernel with a shape that accommodates the additional dimension(s) and performing the tensor multiplication accordingly.

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement such a custom layer in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomDenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDenseLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[1], input_shape[2], self.units),
            initializer='glorot_uniform',
            name='kernel')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[1], self.units),
            initializer='zeros',
            name='bias')

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Perform tensor multiplication using tf.einsum
        # This allows for different operations across the second dimension
        outputs = tf.einsum('bij,jik->bik', inputs, self.kernel)
        outputs += self.bias
        return self.activation(outputs)

# Example usage
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomDenseLayer(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 20)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
print(model.summary())
```

This custom layer (`CustomDenseLayer`) takes inputs of shape `(batch_size, d0, d1)` and applies a unique operation across the `d0` dimension using a stack of kernels, one for each slice along `d0`. The output shape from this layer will be `(batch_size, d0, units)`, where each slice along `d0` has been independently processed.

The documentation states:\n\nNote: if the input to the layer has a rank greater than 2, then it is flattened prior to the initial dot product with kernel.\n\nMy interpretation of this claim is: if we have input tensor with shape (None, 10, 10) then dense layer with 20 hidden units should produce output with a shape (None, 20) and the kernel should have a shape of (10 * 10, 20), and input tensor should be flattened to shape (None, 100) before product with kernel.\n\nBut, implementation is different.\n\nKernel is initialized to shape (10, 20) (for the example above)\n\nself.kernel = self.add_weight( # method Dense#build 'kernel', shape=[input_shape[-1].value, self.units], initializer=self.kernel_initializer, regularizer=self.kernel_regularizer, constraint=self.kernel_constraint, dtype=self.dtype, trainable=True)\n\nThe output is computed as tensordot with summation over innermost dimensions\n\n# Broadcasting is required for the inputs. outputs = standard_ops.tensordot(inputs, self.kernel, [[rank - 1], [0]]) # method Dense#call\n\nThis means that for x.shape == (None, 10, 10) and units == 20 the output shape will be (None, 10, 20), and that kernel is broadcasted for all other dimensions (this means weights are shared).\n\nCode to reproduce the issue\n\nimport tensorflow as tf tf.enable_eager_execution() x = tf.random.normal((10, 10, 10)) y = tf.layers.dense(x, 20) print(y.shape) # Produces (10, 10, 20) not (10, 20) as expected.\n\nDiscussion Three possible things are happening here:\n\nDocumentation is wrong and implementation is correct, and a dense layer is meant to accept only rank 2-dimensional input (batchSize, a dimension of input vector) and if we pass it higher rank it treats it as a stack of input vectors. The solution is to change the documentation (specifically the note part), it should state something like numpy's documentation for matmul:""]","The user is seeking to confirm their understanding of how the tf.keras.layers.Dense layer applies a single kernel across slices of the second dimension for inputs with rank greater than 2, and they are inquiring about the possibility of using a stack of kernels for such inputs instead of the default behavior."

<p>works but</p>

i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i,10)
tf.while_loop(c,b, [i])

<p>throws a ValueError: Attempt to convert a value (None) with an unsupported type() to a Tensor</p>

<p>In 2.0, eager execution is default, I wonder what's the problem?!</p>
","<p>You forgot to add return statement to your function:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import tensorflow as tf

def b(i):
    return tf.add(i, 1)

i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)
tf.while_loop(c, b, [i]) # &lt;tf.Tensor: id=51, shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=10&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in your first example function <code>b</code> does return incremented value:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>i = tf.constant(0)
b = lambda i: tf.add(i,1)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i,10)
tf.while_loop(c,b, [i])
print(b(1).numpy()) # 2
</code></pre>
",,,"The user is trying to understand why their code using tf.while_loop with a defined function as the body throws a ValueError when eager execution is enabled in TensorFlow 2.0, despite the function being a Python callable."

",HumanEval/119,"The function `match_parens` takes a list of two strings, each consisting of only open '(' or close ')' parentheses. The goal is to determine if there is a way to concatenate these two strings such that the resulting string has balanced parentheses. A string is considered balanced if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. To solve this problem, we can follow these steps: 1. Concatenate the two strings in both possible orders. 2. Check if either concatenated string is balanced. 3. Return 'Yes' if at least one of the concatenated strings is balanced, otherwise return 'No'. To check if a string is balanced, we can use a counter that increments for each opening parenthesis and decrements for each closing parenthesis. If the counter is ever negative, it means there are more closing parentheses than opening ones at that point, and the string is not balanced. Additionally, the counter should be zero at the end of the string for it to be balanced.

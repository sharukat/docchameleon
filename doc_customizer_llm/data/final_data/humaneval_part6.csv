",HumanEval/41,"The problem involves determining the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other on a straight line. Since all cars move at the same speed and are infinitely sturdy, each car from the left-to-right set will collide with exactly one car from the right-to-left set.

",HumanEval/43,"The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. The approach to solve this problem is to use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, for each element, we check if its negation is already in the set. If it is, we return `True` because we have found two elements that sum to zero. If we finish iterating through the list without finding such a pair, we return `False`. This approach ensures that we only need to traverse the list once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n).

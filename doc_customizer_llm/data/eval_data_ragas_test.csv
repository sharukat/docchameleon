56286350,tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity,Documentation Replication on Other Examples,tf.keras.metrics.SpecificityAtSensitivity num_thresholds interpretation,"<p>I'm trying to get my head around <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/metrics/SensitivityAtSpecificity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity</a>. I'm fine with the concept of sensity and specificity in isolation, but I'm unsure how the two are related in this single metric.</p>

<p>More specifically, I'm unsure how to interpret the <code>num_thresholds</code> argument. The example in documentation has <code>num_thresholds=1</code>. Setting <code>num_thresholds</code> greater than 1 with the same input data seems to always return a metric value of 1.0.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def print_metric_value(num_thresholds):
    # other values based on docs example
    m = tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity(
        0.4, num_thresholds=num_thresholds)
    m.update_state([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.9])
    print('Result with num_thresholds = %d: %.1f' %
          (num_thresholds, m.result().numpy()))

print_metric_value(1)    # 0.5 - same as docs
print_metric_value(2)    # 1.0
print_metric_value(200)  # 1.0
</code></pre>
","<p>The <code>num_thresholds</code> refers to the number of thresholds. But you might ask: what is a threshold (in this context)? And the answer is that the threshold, which is in the range [0,1], is actually the value which all the predictions greater than that will be considered as positive (i.e. 1) and all the prediction lower than that will be considered as negative (i.e. 0). </p>

<p>For example, consider the prediction vector as <code>[0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.9]</code> which are actually confidences scores (e.g. probabilities). Now if we apply the threshold value of <code>0.1</code>, we get <code>[0, 1, 1, 1]</code>; or if we apply threshold value of <code>0.6</code> we get <code>[0, 0, 0, 1]</code> (i.e. only the confidence of last prediction is higher than <code>0.6</code>).   </p>

<p>Now suppose you want to monitor the changes to specificity at a fixed sensitivity. What <code>SensitivityAtSpecificity</code> metric does is that, to compute the value of sensitivity, it would first compute the specificity at different thresholds and then chooses the threshold which has the closest specificity to the specificity value you have provided (for example, in your question you have given <code>0.4</code> as the specificity value). Then the sensitivity is computed at that threshold and will be returned as the value of this metric. The same thing applies to <code>SpecificityAtSensitivity</code> metric, just swap ""specificity"" and ""sensitivity"" in this paragraph.</p>

<p>You might also ask: what are the threshold values? The answer is if <code>num_thresholds=1</code> then the only threshold is 0.5. If <code>num_thresholds &gt; 1</code> then, besides 0 and 1 as thresholds, the interval (0,1) will be split into <code>num_thresholds - 1</code> equal sub-intervals and the split points are chosen as additional threshold values. For example:</p>

<pre><code>num_threshold  |  thresholds
=============================
1              | [0.5]
2              | [0, 1]
3              | [0, 0.5, 1]
4              | [0, 0.33, 0.66, 1]
5              | [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]

54047604,tf.custom_gradient,Documentation Replication on Other Examples,How to assign custom gradient to TensorFlow op with multiple inputs,"<p>I'm trying to use TensorFlow's <code>@tf.custom_gradient</code> functionality to assign a custom gradient to a function with multiple inputs.  I can put together a working setup for only one input, but not for two or more.</p>

<p>I've based my code on <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/custom_gradient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TensorFlow's custom_gradient documentation</a>, which works just fine for one input, as in this example:</p>

<pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Suppress Tensorflow startup info
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL']='2'

# Custom gradient decorator on a function,
# as described in documentation
@tf.custom_gradient
def my_identity(x):

    # The custom gradient
    def grad(dy):
        return dy

    # Return the result AND the gradient
    return tf.identity(x), grad

# Make a variable, run it through the custom op
x = tf.get_variable('x', initializer=1.)
y = my_identity(x)

# Calculate loss, make an optimizer, train the variable
loss = tf.abs(y)
opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
train = opt.minimize(loss)

# Start a TensorFlow session, initialize variables, train
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    sess.run(train)
</code></pre>

<p>This example runs silently, then closes.  No issues, no errors.  The variable optimizes as expected.  However, in my application, I need to do such a calculation with multiple inputs, so something of this form:</p>

<pre><code>@tf.custom_gradient
def my_identity(x, z):

    def grad(dy):
        return dy

    return tf.identity(x*z), grad
</code></pre>

<p>Running this in place of the example (and adding another variable input to the call of <code>my_identify</code>) results in the following error output.  Best as I can tell, the last parts of the error are from the dynamic generation of the op -- the information format matches the C++ formatting required in the op establishment (though that's about all I know about it).</p>

<p>Based on other custom gradient options, I surmised that the issue was a lack of supplied gradient for the second input argument.  So, I changed my function to this:</p>

<pre><code>@tf.custom_gradient
def my_identity(x, z):

    def grad(dy):
        return dy

    return tf.identity(x*z), grad, grad
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following more familiar error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""testing.py"", line 22, in &lt;module&gt;
    y = my_identity(x, z)
  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/custom_gradient.py"", line 111, in decorated
    return _graph_mode_decorator(f, *args, **kwargs)

    result, grad_fn = f(*args)
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>@custom_gradient</code> decorator is only identifying the last returned element as a gradient.  So, I tried putting the two gradients into a tuple as <code>(grad, grad)</code> such that there would only be ""two"" outputs for the function.  TensorFlow rejected this too, this time because it can't call a tuple like it would a Tensor -- entirely reasonable, in hindsight.</p>

<p>I've fussed around with the example some more, but to no avail.  No matter what I try, I can't get the custom-defined gradient to deal with multiple inputs.  I'm hoping that somebody with more knowledge than I regarding custom ops and gradients will have a better idea on this -- thanks in advance for the help!</p>
","<p>If we use multiple variables as input, the number of gradients return from ""grad"" function should be equals to number of input variables, though we maybe don't care about some of them. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>@tf.custom_gradient
def my_multiple(x,z):

def grad(dy):
    # return two gradients, one for 'x' and one for 'z'
    return (dy*z, dy*x)

return tf.identity(x*z), grad
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the second output of ""my_multiple"" is a function, not a gradient tensor. </p>

59361689,tf.keras.backend,Documentation Replication on Other Examples,Redundancies in tf.keras.backend and tensorflow libraries,"<p>I have been working in TensorFlow for about a year now, and I am transitioning from TF 1.x to TF 2.0, and I am looking for some guidance on how to use the <code>tf.keras.backend</code> library in TF 2.0. I understand that the transition to TF 2.0 is supposed to remove a lot of redundancies in modeling and building graphs, since there were many ways to create equivalent layers in earlier TensorFlow versions (and I'm insanely grateful for that change!), but I'm getting stuck on understanding when to use <code>tf.keras.backend</code>, because the operations appear redundant with other TensorFlow libraries. </p>

<p>I see that some of the functions in <code>tf.keras.backend</code> are redundant with other TensorFlow libraries. For instance, <code>tf.keras.backend.abs</code> and <code>tf.math.abs</code> are not aliases (or at least, they're not listed as aliases in the documentation), but both take the absolute value of a tensor. After examining the source code, it looks like <code>tf.keras.backend.abs</code> calls the <code>tf.math.abs</code> function, and so I really do not understand why they are not aliases. Other <code>tf.keras.backend</code> operations don't appear to be duplicated in TensorFlow libraries, but it looks like there are TensorFlow functions that can do equivalent things. For instance, <code>tf.keras.backend.cast_to_floatx</code> can be substituted with <code>tf.dtypes.cast</code> as long as you explicitly specify the dtype. I am wondering two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>when is it best to use the <code>tf.keras.backend</code> library instead of the equivalent TensorFlow functions?</li>
<li>is there a difference in these functions (and other equivalent <code>tf.keras.backend</code> functions) that I am missing?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Short answer: Prefer tensorflow's native API such as <code>tf.math.*</code> to the<code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> API wherever possible.</p>

<p>Longer answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> API can be <em>mostly</em> viewed as a remnant of the <code>keras.backend.*</code> API. The latter is a design that serves the ""exchangeable backend"" design of the original (non-TF-specific) keras. This relates to the historical aspect of keras, which supports multiple backend libraries, among which tensorflow used to be just one of them. Back in 2015 and 2016, other backends, such as Theano and MXNet were quite popular too. But going into 2017 and 2018, tensorflow became the dominant backend of keras users. Eventually keras became a part of the tensorflow API (in 2.x and later minor versions of 1.x). In the old multi-backend world, the <code>backend.*</code> API provides a backend-independent abstraction over the myriad of supported backend. But in the tf.keras world, the value of the backend API is much more limited.</li>
<li>The various functions in <code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> can be divided into a few categories:

<ol>
<li>Thin wrappers around the equivalent or mostly-equivalent tensorflow native API. Examples: <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L2363"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.less</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L2431"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.sin</a></li>
<li>Slightly thicker wrappers around tensorflow native APIs, with more features included. Examples: <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L2589"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.batch_normalization</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4869"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.conv2d</a>(<a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4869"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L4869</a>). They often perform proprocessing and implement other logics, which make your life easier than using native tensorflow API.</li>
<li>Unique functions that don't have equivalent in the native tensorflow API. Examples: <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L3809"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.rnn</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py#L342"" rel=""noreferrer"">tf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>For category 1, use native tensorflow APIs. For categories 2 and 3, you may want to use the <code>tf.keras.backend.*</code> API, as long as you can find it in the documentation page: <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/</a>, because the documented ones have backward compatibility guarantees, so that you don't need to worry about a future version of tensorflow removing it or changing its behavior.</p>

56047272,tf.constant,Documentation Replication on Other Examples,Explicit vs implicit type definition in TensorFlow,"<p>I'm just beginning to learn TensorFlow. Quoting from the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/low_level_intro#graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's build a simple computational graph. The most basic operation is a constant. The Python function that builds the operation takes a tensor value as input. The resulting operation takes no inputs. When run, it outputs the value that was passed to the constructor. We can create two floating point constants a and b as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>a = tf.constant(3.0, dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant(4.0) # also tf.float32 implicitly
total = a + b
print(a)
print(b)
print(total)
</code></pre>

<p>The second constant is implicitly typed as a float32. Is that based on the explicit typing of the first constant? And does that imply that the first <code>dtype</code> is required? <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/constant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tf.constant documentation</a> would imply that it does not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the argument dtype is not specified, then the type is inferred from the type of <code>value</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then it would be unnecessary to explicitly type the 3.0 constant above.</p>

<p>I'm just looking for some clarification on this, since, like I said, I'm just starting out.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>But then it would be unnecessary to explicitly type the 3.0 constant
  above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely correct. </p>

<pre><code>a = tf.constant(3.0, dtype=tf.float32)
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>a = tf.constant(3.0)
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation is just demonstrating the different overloads. We might choose to explicitly provide the type if we want a different numerical precision (or even just to aid human readability) but if you want the default data type TF infers, then it's entirely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Besides, the main difference between <code>sampled_softmax_loss</code> and <code>softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits</code> (the standard cross_entropy loss in TF) is that the first only takes into account a subset V of your vocabulary to calculate your loss, while the second takes into account your entire vocabulary.</p>

59531864,tf.nn.conv1d,Documentation Replicability,Why does TensorFlow calculate 2D convolutions when 1D convolution is called?,"<p>In the documentation of tf.nn.conv1d, it is stated that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally, this op reshapes the input tensors and invokes tf.nn.conv2d. For example, if data_format does not start with ""NC"", a tensor of shape [batch, in_width, in_channels] is reshaped to [batch, 1, in_width, in_channels], and the filter is reshaped to [1, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]. The result is then reshaped back to [batch, out_width, out_channels] (where out_width is a function of the stride and padding as in conv2d) and returned to the caller.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get that the operations are equivalent, but I am a bit confused about the implications of this implementation detail. </p>

<p>Does the reshaping create some computational overhead? 
The 3D convolution has its own implementation, so why not the 1D convolution?</p>

<p>Thanks for any explanation that helps me and others to understand this implementation detail of TensorFlow!</p>
","<p>Digging through the source code, I conclude that it's likely done for convenience and minimalism of implementation - details below. </p>

<p>First, there is no ""reshaping"", only expanding, squeezing, and re-ordering dims, which bears a tiny overhead; no array elements are actually being moved in memory - only the tensor object's indexing specifiers are changed.</p>

<p>Second, all <code>conv</code> ultimately route to <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cf0898dd4331baf93fe77205550f2c2e6c90ee5/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_ops.py#L942"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>tf.nn_ops.convolution_internal</code></a>, which then routes to either <code>gen_nn_ops.conv2d</code> or <code>gen_nn_ops.conv3d</code>; a <code>conv1d</code> does not exist in <code>gen_nn_ops.py</code>. Note that for some reason, you won't find that file in the Git respository - but it should be in your local install, <code>/python/ops/gen_nn_ops.py</code>.</p>

<p>Lastly, to get a real answer on why there isn't a dedicated <code>conv1d</code> implementation, you'll need to ask the cuDNN developers behind the convolution algorithms found in <code>gen_nn_ops.py</code>; it's possible that they found no performance improvements, and that <code>conv2d</code> works just as fast. From a low-level standpoint, this makes sense, as the number of matrix multiplications in sliding a kernel with <code>N x 1</code> elements along an <code>M x 1</code> input is identical to that of <code>N</code> along <code>M</code> - again, the only difference is in indexing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately devs decided to encapsulate the ultimate call, that is to <code>_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.TFE_Py_FastPathExecute</code>; the module consists of a <code>.lib</code> and a <code>.pyd</code> file - basically, compiled C (Cython) code that requires disassembly for introspection. </p>

<hr>

<p>TL;DR (1) the ""reshaping"" has a trivial overhead; (2) lack of a dedicated <code>conv1d</code> implementation is likely per sparing redundancy as <code>conv2d</code> is just as fast; (3) I'm not a cuDNN expert, so if you need to be sure, better ask over at <a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cuDNN</a>, or read their <a href=""https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-developer-guide/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SDK Documentation</a>. Alternatively, a dev at <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TF Github</a> may help. I haven't seen cuDNN devs answer on SO for years now, so posting here may not be the best bet.</p>

<p>But the expected output is a matrix with a dimension of <code>3x2x4</code>, not <code>3x4</code>. Does <code>tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse</code> support this operation?</p>
","<p>The most easier way to do so is to make the sparse tensor as a 2D tensor and get the weights of the embedding matrix and then reshape.</p>

<p>So, forget the 3D sparse tensor, simply convert it to 2D tensor. Because you only care about the values (index of rows, which are used to get the corresponding rows of the embedding matrix) in the sparse tensor.</p>

63004540,tf.pad,Documentation Replicability,How to pad 1 dimensinal vector in tensorflow? Getting InvalidArgumentError: paddings must be a matrix with 2 columns with tf.pad,"<p>I am trying to use tf.pad. Here is my attempt to pad the tensor to length 20, with values 10.</p>
<pre><code>tf.pad(tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 45]), paddings=20, constant_values=10)
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error message</p>
<pre><code>InvalidArgumentError: paddings must be a matrix with 2 columns: [2,1] [Op:PadV2]
</code></pre>
<p>I am looking at the documentation</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/pad"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/pad</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>paddings is an integer tensor with shape [n, 2], where n is the rank of tensor. For each dimension D of input, paddings[D, 0] indicates how many values to add before the contents of tensor in that dimension, and paddings[D, 1] indicates how many values to add after the contents of tensor in that dimension</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I am unable to figure out how to shape the pad value</p>
","<p>You have to specify the padding at the beginning and the padding at the end of your vector by matrix of shape (1,2) :</p>
<pre><code>tf.pad(tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 45]), [[ 0 , 20]], constant_values=10)
</code></pre>
<p>if you have three-dimensional tensor (rank = 3 e.g : (225,225,3) ) the padding matrix has to be of shape (3, 2 ) where &quot;3&quot; is the rank, and &quot;2&quot; to specify the padding at the beginning and end of each dimension.</p>
<p>For example, a padding matrix  = [ [0,2], [5,5], [2,0] ], means that we want to pad the first dimension by 0 at the beginning (=no padding) and 2 at the end .padding the second dimension by 5 at beginning and 5 at the end.</p>

57449484,tf.compat.v1.layers.batch_normalization,Documentation Replicability,What is trainable parameter in tensorflow?,"<p>tf.compat.v1.layers.batch_normalization takes <code>trainable</code> as an input. The documentation says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boolean, if True also add variables to the graph collection GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES (see tf.Variable).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think only scaling factor (gamma) and offset (beta) should be added to trainable variables and I am skeptical if even moving averages will get added to GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES. Can somebody tell me how trainable input is influencing the behavior of batch_normalization</p>
","<p>First of all, this function is <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/batch_normalization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deprecated</a> and should not be used.</p>

<p><code>trainable</code> arguments means that scaling factor (gamma) and offset (beta) will be trainable and it's true by default.</p>

<p>When it comes to moving averages, those <strong>are not trainable</strong>, they are only updated after each batch pass, those are not parameters (<code>tf.Variable</code> objects).</p>

<p>Please notice, you can set <code>trainable</code> to false, in such case, if <code>beta</code> and <code>gamma</code> are set to defaults (zero and one respectively), they won't affect the moving averages. You can turn them off by issuing <code>center</code> (for <code>beta</code>) or <code>scale</code> (for <code>gamma</code>).</p>

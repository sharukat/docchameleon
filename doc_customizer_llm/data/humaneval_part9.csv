",HumanEval/16,"The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, regardless of their case. To achieve this, we can convert the string to lowercase (or uppercase) to ensure case insensitivity, then use a set to store unique characters and return the size of the set.
No imports are required for this function.

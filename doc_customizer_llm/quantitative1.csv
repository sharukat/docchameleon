You either need to load the images from the server the applet is been loaded from (using getDocument/CodeBase or a relative URL), or based on your example, as embedded an resource, for example

tileset_terrain = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(""/res/tileset_terrain.png""));
This assumes that the image is included within the Jar file under the /res directory.

If the image resides on the server from which the applet is been load, you could also use

try {
    URL url = new URL(getCodeBase(), ""res/tileset_terrain.png"");
    img = ImageIO.read(url);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
Take a look at Reading/Loading images and What Applets Can and Cannot Do for more details.","To load and display local images in a Java Applet, you should use the following strategies:

1. Create an Image object: You can use the getImage method provided by the Applet class to load your image. Make sure the image file is in the same directory as your Applet class file or provide the appropriate path. Here's an example:
```java
Image image = getImage(getCodeBase(), ""image.jpg"");
```

2. Display the Image: Use the drawImage method to display the loaded Image on your Applet. You might also need to extend the Applet class or use relevant classes like Swing's JLabel or Processing's PImage class depending on your project's requirements.

3. Handling Exceptions: The getImage method might throw an IOException, so it's recommended to handle this exception using a try-catch block.

4. Loading Images from JAR: If your images are packed within a JAR file, you can use the getClass().getResource method to load them. Make sure the image files are in the root directory of the JAR file. Here's an example:
```java
Image image = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(""/image.jpg""));
```

5. Using ImageObserver or MediaTracker: When loading images asynchronously, you can use ImageObserver or MediaTracker to track the loading status of your images and display them only when they are fully loaded.

Remember that Applets have security restrictions, so they might not have permission to access local files, especially if served from a different domain. In such cases, consider loading images from the server or embedding them within the JAR file."

Whenever a new JVM is started the bootstrap classloader is responsible to load key Java classes (from java.lang package) and other runtime classes to the memory first. The bootstrap classloader is a parent of all other classloaders. Consequently, it is the only one without a parent.

Next comes the extension classloader. It has the bootstrap classloader as parent and is responsible for loading classes from all .jar files kept in the java.ext.dirs pathâ€“these are available regardless of the JVMâ€™s classpath.

The third and most important classloader from a developerâ€™s perspective is the system classpath classloader, which is an immediate child of the extension classloader. It loads classes from directories and jar files specified by the CLASSPATH environment variable, java.class.path system property or -classpath command line option.

Classloader hierarchy

ClassLoader Namespace

In Java a class is uniquely identified using ClassLoader + Class as the same class may be loaded by two different class loaders.

Class A loaded by ClassLoader A != Class A loaded by ClassLoader B
How is it helpful?

It is helpful for defining different protection and access policies for different classloaders. Take an example of applet which is loaded using a different classloader, you would not want a third party application all access to your resources. So for security its important to maintain different namespaces.","According to my search, you may be experiencing an access control issue, especially if your application is signed. You could try creating a new instance of URLClassLoader with the URLs of the jar files you are trying to access and run them using loadClass() method. Make sure that your classes are public and that you have a public no-argument constructor.

If you are trying to load classes from a separate directory, you might want to look into packing all your classes into a single jar file or using a URLClassLoader. You could also use the Applet classloader to access classes but this may not work if your applet is unsigned."

Make sure that your applet jar(s) are signed, and that you understand all other consequences of running an applet.","Due to security reasons, Java applets are restricted from accessing the local file system. However, there are some workarounds to this issue.

One method is to use a digitally signed applet, which, when executed, will prompt the user to allow the applet to access the file system. Another method is to request the server to write to its own file system.

Additionally, according to one source, reading the content of a file located on a server is possible using the java.net.URL and java.net.URLConnection classes."

There shouldn t be any problem (other than any general problems you might have with very large images).</li> <li>
If you re talking about adding multiple images to a single panel  I would use <code>ImageIcon</code>s.
For a single image  I would think about making a custom subclass of <code>JPanel</code> and overriding its <code>paintComponent</code>
<p><code>JPanel</code> is almost always the wrong class to subclass.
<p>There is a slight problem with <code>ImageIcon</code> in that the constructor blocks reading the image.
Not really a problem when loading from the application jar  but maybe if you re potentially reading over a network connection.
<p>I m doing something very similar in a private project I m working on.
Thus far I ve generated images up to 1024x1024 without any problems (except memory) and can display them very quickly and without any performance problems.
<p>Overriding the paint method of JPanel subclass is overkill and requires more work than you need to do.
This reduces the amount of flashing done while you generate your images  and you can thread it.
<p>So then I use a JScrollPane to hold the MapLabel  which contains only the MapIcon.
<p>But for your scenario (just show the whole image every time).
You need to add the MapLabel to the top JPanel  and make sure to size them all to the full size of the image (by overriding the GetPreferredSize()).
<p>Set an <code>EmptyBorder</code> around your <code>JPanel</code>.<br>
generally you add padding with the layout manager you are using.
There are cases that you can just expand the border of the <code>JPanel</code>.</p>
<p>I will suppose your JPanel contains JTextField  for the sake of the demo.</p>
method which seems to be what you re looking for.</p>
Since it doesn t have to keep the elements sorted  <code>LinkedHashMap</code>
This will allow you not to leak specific implementations into your API and switch to either of those specific classes or a completely different implementation at will afterwards.</p>
<p>LinkedHashMap will return the elements in the order they were inserted into the map when you iterate over the keySet()  entrySet() or values() of the map.
Obviously put and remove are not supported.
<p>You can use <strong>LinkedHashMap</strong> to main insertion order in Map</p> <p>
LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key.</p> </li> <li><p>
<p>You can maintain a <code>Map</code> (for fast lookup) and <code>List</code> (for order) but a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>
may be the simplest.
<ul> <li>Insertion order is maintained  by using LinkedHashMap internally.</li> <li>Keys with <code>null</code>
Once key with value is created  we are not overriding its value.</li> </ul>
@SuppressWarnings({  rawtypes    unchecked  }) public class CustomHashMap&lt;K  V&gt; implements CustomMap&lt;K  V&gt; {     private Map&lt;K  V&gt; entryMap;     // SET: Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present.
@Override     public boolean insertionRule(K key  V value) {         // KEY as null and EMPTY String is not allowed.
If key already available then  we are not overriding its value.
<p>If you know the KEY s are fixed then you can use EnumMap.
http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Collections-Data-Structure/ArrayMapextendsAbstractMap.htm  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this implementation of Map using ArrayList</a>.
It seems to be pre-1.5 Java  so you might want to genericize it  which should be easy.
Note that this implementation has O(N) access  but this shouldn t be a problem if you don t add hundreds of widgets to your JPanel  which you shouldn t anyway.</p>
<p>Whenever i need to maintain the natural order of things that are known ahead of time  i use a <a href= 
<p>the keys will be enums and you can insert in any order you want but when you iterate it will iterate in the enum order (the natural order).
<p>Also when using EnumMap there should be no collisions which can be more efficient.
<p>I really find that using enumMap makes for clean readable code.
<p>LinkedHashMap is used for maintaing insertion order.
The LinkedHashMap class of the Collections framework is the Hashtable and LinkedList implementation of the Map interface.
<p>The problem is  a component can only reside in a single container  once  so doing something like...</p>
<p>What I would suggest you do is create a  wrapper  or  card  panel which can contain the two images.
<p>Yes  it is most definitely possible to do this.

io,Serializable,Java Serializable Object to Byte Array,"<p>To add to the other answers  by implementating <code>java.io.Serializable</code>  you get  automatic  serialization capability for objects of your class.
The Java runtime will use reflection to figure out how to marshal and unmarshal your objects.</p>
<p>In earlier version of Java  reflection was very slow  and so serializaing large object graphs (e.g. in client-server RMI applications) was a bit of a performance problem.
<p>In recent versions of Java (1.3 onwards  certainly) the performance of reflection is vastly better than it used to be  and so this is much less of a problem.
<p>Also  the built-in Java serialization mechanism isn t the only one  you can get third-party replacements  such as JBoss Serialization  which is considerably quicker  and is a drop-in replacement for the default.</p>
<p>Serialization provides default functionality to store and later recreate the object.

But if you want restricted serialization or don t want some portion of your object to be serialized then use Externalizable.
The Externalizable interface extends the Serializable interface and adds two methods  writeExternal() and readExternal().
While working with Externalizable we should remember that the default constructer should be public else the code will throw exception.

A Java object is only serializable.
Most of the java class are serializable</em>.</p>
<p>Object Serialization produces a stream with information about the Java classes for the objects which are being saved.
For serializable objects  sufficient information is kept to restore those objects even if a different (but compatible) version of the implementation of the class is present.
The Serializable interface is defined to identify classes which implement the serializable protocol:</p>
The serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to identify the semantics of being serializable.
For serializing/deserializing a class  either we can use default writeObject and readObject methods (or) we can overriding writeObject and readObject methods from a class.</li>
The values of the non-transient and non-static fields of the class get serialized.</li> </ul>
<p>For Externalizable objects  only the identity of the class of the object is saved by the container; the class must save and restore the contents.
The Externalizable interface has two methods  an externalizable object must implement a writeExternal and readExternal methods to save/restore the state of an object.</li> <li>
Programmer has to take care of which objects to be serialized.
As a programmer take care of Serialization So  here transient keyword will not restrict any object in Serialization process.</li> <li>
When an Externalizable object is reconstructed  an instance is created using the public no-arg constructor  then the readExternal method called.
<p>Default serialization is somewhat verbose  and assumes the widest possible usage scenario of the serialized object  and accordingly the default format (Serializable) annotates the resultant stream with information about the class of the serialized object.</p>
<p>Externalization give the producer of the object stream complete control over the precise class meta-data (if any) beyond the minimal required identification of the class (e.g. its name).
This is clearly desirable in certain situations  such as closed environments  where producer of the object stream and its consumer (which reifies the object from the stream) are matched  and additional metadata about the class serves no purpose and degrades performance.</p>
<p>Additionally (as Uri point out) externalization also provides for complete control over the encoding of the data in the stream corresponding to Java types.
For (a contrived) example  you may wish to record boolean true as  Y  and false as  N .
<p>The Externalizable interface was not actually provided to optimize the serialization process performance!
but to provide means of implementing your own custom processing and offer complete control over the format and contents of the stream for an object and its super types!</p>
<p>When considering options for improving performance  don t forget custom serialization.
You can let Java do what it does well  or at least good enough  <em>for free</em>  and provide custom support for what it does badly.
<p>There are so many difference exist between Serializable and Externalizable but when we compare difference between custom Serializable(overrided writeObject() &amp; readObject()) and Externalizable  then we find that custom implementation is tightly bind with ObjectOutputStream class where as in Externalizable case   we ourself provide an implementation of ObjectOutput which may be ObjectOutputStream class or it could be some other like org.apache.mina.filter.codec.serialization.ObjectSerializationOutputStream</p>
We can comment below two method and use default serialization process as well              Sequence of class attributes in read and write methods MUST BE same.
We can define custom validation or business rules inside read/write methods.

<p>Serialization adds constraints and potential problems since structure compatibility is not insured.
So the effort you d spend making the class serializble properly dwarves the cost of adding the interface.
<p>For some classes  especially those that represent something more physical like a File  a Socket  a Thread  or a DB connection  it makes absolutely no sense to serialize instances.
For many others  Serialization may be problematic because it destroys uniqueness constraints  or simply forces you to deal with instances of different versions of a class  which you may not want to.</p>
<p>Arguably  it might have been better to make everything Serializable by default and make classes non-serializable through a keyword or marker interface - but then  those who should use that option probably would not think about it.
<p>Apparently everything was serializable in some preliminary designs  but because of security and correctness concerns the final design ended up as we all know.</p>
<p>Having to state explicitely that instances of a certain class are Serializable the language forces you to think about if you you should allow that.
For simple value objects serialization is trivial  but in more complex cases you need to really think things through.</p>
<p>By just relying on the standard serialization support of the JVM you expose yourself to all kinds of nasty versioning issues.</p>
<p>Uniqueness  references to  real  resources  timers and lots of other types of artifacts are NOT candidates for serialization.</p>
Other languages happily try serializing everything that doesn t jump on a tree after you ve counted to 10.

1. Py4J uses a text protocol and byte arrays are encoded with base64 which definitely slows down the reading process compared to reading a stream directly from Python or Java.
2. If you are using Jetty and Servlet lifecycle is blocking it might slow down the InputStream. 

Here are some possible solutions:
1. Use third-party libraries like FastJavaIO which provides InputReader that reads data from an InputStream much faster than Java's native InputStream.
2. If you are dealing with a CPU-consuming issue, you can look into Javalin or plain Jetty to see if there are any improvements."

```java
List<co: 0,1,2,3,4,5>String strings = Arrays.asList(""a"", ""bc"", ""d"", ""e"");
String max = strings.stream().max(Comparator.comparingInt(String::length)).get();
System.out.println(max);
```
The code uses the Collections.max() method to find the largest string in the array."

sb = sb.append(line).append(""\n"");","There can be many reasons why your strings are not preserving line breaks when written to a file. Here are some solutions that might help you :
1. While reading the file, use LineNumberReader or BufferedReader instead of a Scanner. If you are using a BufferedReader, add a newline character (\n) after reading each line.
2. When writing the string to a file, use the newline parameter. For example, while opening a file in Python, you can use newline='' to read or write line endings untranslated.
3. If you are dealing with a Bash shell, remember to quote variables, especially when working with strings, to preserve the line breaks.
4. In Java, you can also replace the line breaks with the platform-specific newline character like so : 
string.replace(""\\n"", System.getProperty(""line.separator""));
5. In HTML, you can set the white-space property of the element you're inserting the text into to pre-wrap to preserve line breaks. Alternatively, you can also use the  <pre> tag."
